\textsc{\textbf{Abstract}} \hspace{1em} Can we extend large microcredit lending to the ultra-poor, who are typically excluded from the microcredit access? With a randomised controlled trial in a rural, low income setting of northern Bangladesh, we assess the creditworthiness of the ultra poor and suitability of various debt contract designs to help them escape from poverty through productive investments. We use a stepped-wedge design over the key features of loans, i.e., small-scale sequential disbursement vs. lumpy upfront disbursement, with vs. without a grace period, and cash vs. in-kind loan with a managerial support program, each corresponds to a liquidity constraint, a saving constraint, and an entrepreneurship constraint, respectively. Compared with the traditional microcredit, provision of large, upfront liquidity increases the net assets by 
	0.84 times the baseline overall standard deviation in the second year ($p$ value=0.07\%), 
	1.15 times by the fourth year ($p$ value=0.03\%), and their repayment rates are higher.
These results hold broadly regardless of different contents of assets or with different cattle rearing experiences prior to the intervention. This is consistent with the existence of an asset-based poverty trap which can be overcome by increasing the loan size. Provision of a grace period does not change the repayment rates or asset levels. Managerial supports induce participation of less experienced and poorer households to microfinance, yet resulted in similar repayment rates and asset accumulation as with other participants, indicating a farther successful outreach to the ultra poor. Our main findings, a large, upfront disbursement results in faster asset accumulation that is suggestive of an escape from a poverty trap and managerial support programs induce the participation of the ultra poor, are expected to be generalisable to other rural areas relying on small livestock under a liquidity constraint.

\textbf{\textbf{Revisions}}

\vspace{2ex}
Overall changes:
\begin{enumerate}
\vspace{1.0ex}\setlength{\itemsep}{1.0ex}\setlength{\baselineskip}{12pt}
\item	Intro, empirical strategy, results, conclusion are rewritten to align with experimental design. We have not written the impacts of saving and entreprenuership constraints which are two of main design components of experimental design. These are added now. This is the major part of the revision.
\item	In existing studies and intro, relying on Buera et al. and Cull and Morduch, we place this study as the impact study on the greenfield population. This contrasts with the studies from MFI rich area. Similar studies to ours show larger impacts than those from MFI rich areas (=mostly estimating impacts on intensive margins or existing borrowers).
\item	I found and corrected errors in codes of schooling impacts. Now primary school aged boys wiyth \textsf{Upfront} functional attribute are mildly negatively affected in later periods. This is mostly from \textsf{Large} arm while \textsf{Large grace} and \textsf{Cattle} arms show more positive impacts, which hints not having a grace period may hurt, but we have no information to back up such a hunch.
\item	I tested for impact difference by poverty class, and found ultra poor's consumption is smaller in later periods. Other outcomes are not different by poverty class.
\item	For consistency, I changed the names: broad net assets $\Rightarrow$ net broad assets. Only the names are changed.
\item	The biggest challenge in my view is to defend the precision of our net assset measure. The main results show the impacts on net assets values. I used several variations in asset definitions and found the results to be the same. But all of these assets may be equally poorly measured. 
\item	One suggestion from Abu-san that I have not tried is pooling post periods to gain stat power. This makes sense for flow variables such as consumption and incomes, but not so much for stock variables as they may be trending and pooling makes estimates noisier. 
\end{enumerate}

I highlighted corrected texts \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{like this}.

\textbf{\textbf{Contrasts with \citet{Balboni2020}}}
\setlength{\parindent}{1em}

	\citet{Balboni2020} collect data from transfer recipients and control group of BRAC's TUP. Using the recipient data, they estimate the equation of motion $K_{t+1}=\phi(K_{t})$, show the S shape, and compute the threshold asset level $\hat{k}$ that separates the low and high equilibria. They then show that individuals who are above $\hat{k}$ increase the assets while individuals below it decrease them. The variations of initial asset level allows the identification of bifurcation as these variations effectively allocate inidividuals to below and above the threshold. Anticipating the endogeneity of initial asset levels to asset growths, they show that initial asset levels have no correlation with post intervention asset growths after conditioning on the above-threshold dummy. This is suggestive evidence that the unobservables that correlate with initial asset levels are exogenous to post-transfer asset increases.

	In the poverty trap dynamics, the key is the low returns among the low $k$ holders. The returns to high $k$ holders are qualitatively similar in the covex and concave production functions so long as they are above the 45 degree line. Why are they low? Authors show the baseline vehicle ownership is statistically smaller by 4\% (but not for other assets, total assets are not tested) for the below threshold households, and the differences relative to the above threshold households grew after the transfer receipt. They conclude that the complimentary assets serve as the fixed inputs of production, and the lack thereof withholds households from escaping the poverty trap.

\item[their strength]	Large sample size, precise asset and labour data, direct estimation of equation of motion, and associated tests of multiple equilibria.

\textbf{\textbf{Contrasts with \citet{Banerjee2019MFPovertyTrap}}}

	\citet{Banerjee2019MFPovertyTrap} use regionally matched-pair data under staggered branch opening of an urban MFI. They divide the sample into borrowers with a prior business experience (GE) and others (non-GE), and show that impacts are persistently positive for GE borrowers but not for non-GE borrowers. With structural estimation, given a talent distribution, they interpret this as evidence of a poverty trap through a liquidity constraint. They also note the impact heterogeneity is due to MFI selection but not talent heterogeneity, as pre-MFI entry businesses are more profitable than post-MFI entry businesses of the same firm age.

\item[their strength]	Urban setting, contrast of long-run versus short-run impacts, data on business outcomes, gross substitute/compliment with demand for informal loans, explaining the lack of average impacts by finding the subpopulation with superior talents and contrasting with other subpopulation.
\item[our strength]	Ultra poor population, rural and fragile setting, selection on entrepreneurship without affecting outcomes, \textsf{Upfront} leads to faster asset accumulation and higher repayment rates.

\section{Introduction}
\label{SecIntroduction}



	After the microcredit became popular in Bangladesh in the late 1980's, the number of borrowers increased rapidly throughout the world. According to over 3700 microfinance institutions (MFIs), there are estimated 204 million borrowers around the world in 2013, of which 110 million are the poor borrowers whose incomes are below the national poverty line \citep{MFGateway2015}. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Since then, financial inclusion of the poor has been a priority in international development. Its funding worldwide reached 22 billion US dollars in 2013 then doubled to 44 billion US dollars in 2020} \citep{Tolzmann2022}.  The outreach to the extremely poor population or the \textit{ultra poor}, however, is arguably slow in comparison.\footnote{MF is not successful in reaching out to the poorest of the poor, or the ultra poor \citep[][]{Scully2004}. Empirical evidence in \citet{Yaron1994, Navajas2000, RahmanRazzaque2000, AghionMorduch2007} supports this claim. Some authors discuss the tradeoff between sustainability and outreach for microfinance institutions (MFIs) \citet{HermesLensink2011, HermesLensinkMeesters2011, Cull2011}. } 

	There are demand and supply side reasons behind the slow outreach to the ultra poor. On the demand side, the ultra poor borrowers may face an inferior production possibility or \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{face a more restrictive constraint in production} than the wealthier borrowers, or may not be entrepreneurial enough to demand credits for production. On the supply side, MFIs may perceive the ultra poor as riskier than the moderately poor, or their loan size may be too small to justify the fixed transaction costs while the lender is constrained to keep the interest rate low to avoid adverse selection and moral hazard. 

	As the rigorous evaluations of microfinance progress, some of the demand side reasons are shown to exist. A group of influential research has shown that only a subgroup of borrowers, those with prior experiences or high ability, leap positive returns from borrowing \citep{Banerjee2015Miracle, Mckenzie2017Spurring, Banerjee2019MFPovertyTrap, BueraKaboskiShin2020}. This is in a stark contrast to the popular belief in the traditional microfinance that anyone can become a successful borrower.\footnote{A leading proponent is the nobel laureate Professor Mohammad Yunus who claims that ``we are all entrepreneurs.'' \citep{Yunus2003}, \citep{Cosic2017} \textcolor{red}{[Abu-san: Can you get the exact page number(s) in his book?} } Logically, there must be some minimal level of entrepreneurship to participate and continue as a borrower in any form of finance. Then, the question is, what sort or how much of entrepreneurship is required for the ultra poor in microfinance? 

	\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Another, recent strand of literature showed that the asset scale may matter in subsequent wealth growth of the poor. Using an experiment that transfers a large sum asset,} \citet{Balboni2020} \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{directly estimated the $S-$shaped poverty trap curve. They cofirmed its existence: Individuals above a threshold level of asset size increase the assets while individuals below it decrease them four years after the transfer. This also calls the popular convention into question. Is the conventional scale of borrowing large enough for a borrower to be economically viable?}

	To shed light on the required level of entrepreneurship and borrowing, we took these questions to the Northern Bangladesh where a flood threat limits the production process to be least complex: livestock rearing. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{About a quarter} of residents own livestock so its know-how is semi-public knowledge. The required entrepreneurship, then, is to gather all the pieces of relevant information, decide to raise livestock, form a production and a sales plan, and implement. This is the definition of entrepreneurship we use in our paper. In our intervention, we provided a heifer to a selected subgroup of participants as an in-kind loan and bundled it with training and consultation services to make sure the borrower has the right cookbook to follow. Under this treatment, the entrepreneurship to decide what to invest and how to come up with a solid plan is no longer a necessity. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{To align the heifer investment cashflow with repayment, we also bundled a grace period so repayment begins one year after the loan disbursement.}

	In our study, we compare the borrowers who were provided with such knowledge and the managerial supports against the borrowers who were not. By randomising the offers, we identify the causal impacts of not requiring the entrepreneurship on both the participation and the outcomes. We find that our managerial support program, that helps filling the gap in entrepreneurial skills, induces residents with fewer experiences in livestock production and a lower asset level to participate, while the outcomes are the same as in the group without managerial supports.%, despite the lower qualification. 

	In bridging these two experimental arms that are different in multiple aspects, we introduced two intermediate arms. One with large upfront liquidity, another with large upfront liquidity with a grace period. These additional features, upfront liquidity, a grace period, and in-kind loan with managerial supports, are intended to relax constraints in productive investsmens by the poor: A liquidity constraint, a saving constraint, and an entrepreneurship constraint. We test if any of these constraints binds in escaping the povery trap. 
	
	By offering large liquidity upfront while keeping the total loan size and maturity equivalent to multiple rounds of traditional microcredit loans, we can see how it matters for the future asset level. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{The investment of choice by residents, a heiffer, creates a cashflow only after one year. So we offer large upfront liquidity with one year grace period of same size, same maturity, and same total interest payments in one experimental arm. We expected there are residents not familar with cattle rearing. In another arm, we offer an in-kind loan in the form of a heiffer with managerial supports that are repayable under the same conditions as in the offer of the large upfront loan with a grace period. }

	If the production technology is nonconvex and if there is a credit constraint, it gives rise to a poverty trap which can result in larger asset accumulation under large upfront liquidity. While we do not directly test for a poverty trap, the investment choices strongly indicate its existence: Only borrowers without a large upfront loan opted for smaller, multiple investments. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Provided that the loan size is chosen appropriately to support livestock procurement of choice, } our experiment can test if the upfront liquidity provision breaks a poverty trap, under an assumption that there is one. We find that it results in larger asset accumulation without affecting the repayment rates. Relative to the traditional microfinance lending, the upfront liquidity provision increases the net assets by 
	0.84 times the baseline overall standard deviation (denoted hereafter with $\sigma$) in the second year ($p$ value=0.07\%), 
	1.15$\sigma$ by the fourth year ($p$ value=0.03\%), 
	and the number of cattle holding by 0.59$\sigma$ in the second year ($p$ value=0.36\%), and 
	0.66$\sigma$ by the end of fourth year ($p$ value=5.65\%).\footnote{The $p$ values are linear hypothesis tests of group level differences using ANCOVA estimates. } These results hold broadly regardless of different cattle rearing experiences prior to the intervention. 

	\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{We find that the saving constraint does not bind. The outcomes and repayment are not different when a grace period is offered additionally. However, we find some indication that the ultra poor exerted more efforts in repayment because of their smaller saving. Their net asset growth is slower during the grace period. This suggests the saving build up was not sufficient prior to loan disbursement. Their consumption is smaller than the moderately poor of the same arm towards the end of repayment. This is suggestive of repayment efforts through consumption suppression. }

	\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{We find the entrepreneurship constraint also does not bind. Offering managerial supports does not marginally affect the outcomes, which makes all other participants without them equally entrepreneurial. But we find farther outreach when managerial supports are provided, as individuals with smaller assets participated.} The borrowers with managerial supports have, on average per household, lower baseline cattle holding rate 0.22 (while other borrowers have .308, $p$ value=15.7\%), and smaller net asset values BDT 5762 (in contrast to BDT 10287, $p$ value=2.8\%).\footnote{The $p$ values are from randomisation tests of group level differences. } The outcomes and repayment rates are no lower than the other borrowers, implying the managerial supports had a farther outreach without compromising the outcomes and loan repayents. 

	Our study follows the literature of microfinance debt contract design as hallmarked in \citet{Field2013} who found a grace period induces more risk taking and subsequent loan delinquency. Under our setting of limited production choices, it is irrational to invest in riskier assets, such as goats, when the designed grace period suits the heifer cash flow and a heifer's risk-return profile is considered to be Pareto-dominating. A strategic default is also more difficult in our setting because the number of formal credit suppliers is limited, which is probably zero,\footnote{As we surveyed the area before the study, we note several NGOs provide a relief credit to flood victims, but not regular finance. In selecting the study site, we purposefully chose the population without access to any financial institution.\textcolor{red}{[Abu-san: A better description for this?]} } and relocation is difficult, because it requires not just moving costs but also financially reliable mainland contacts to help settling in. The repayment rates in our study turned out to be no lower than the comparable microfinance schemes \citep{BanerjeeKarlanZinman2015}.

	Our study is closely related to a large scale cattle transfer study conducted in the neighbouring area \citep{BandieraBRAC2017, Balboni2020}. The targeted population of their study is similar to ours, yet our study population resides on less stable terrain, are more exposed to flood and water logging, are considered to be less well connected to the market, are equally less skilled, and are probably poorer. The chance of survival for each investment project is expected to be no higher. More prominently, our study is more commercially oriented: It uses a loan than a transfer, and charge market level fees to all the services provided.

	We consider our finding is generalisable to rural areas where small scale livestock production is prevalent. While there is a caveat that the domain of our results is a low level herd size and the entrepreneurial capacity to hold a larger herd size can be different from what our study suggests,\footnote{Our study matches the scale of lower equilibrium of \citet{Lybbertetal2004} which is much smaller than the scale of the high equilibrium of around 50 herd size. } the successful livestock transfer program in the neighbouring areas \citep{BandieraBRAC2017, Balboni2020} and our results indicate that supporting asset accumulation through large livestock has wide applicability in assisting the rural ultra poor to escape from poverty.

\section{A brief review of existing studies}
\label{SecExistingStudies}

	There are four aspects in our study that relate to the existing literature: The role of entrepreneurship in microfinance impacts, variations in debt contract design, empirical assessment of a poverty trap, and targeting the ultra poor. We will discuss these in turn.

	Much has been discussed about the poverty reduction impacts of microfinance in the early days of microfinance studies \citep{PittKhandker1998, Morduch1999}. Recently, doubts are cast on the magnitude of microfinance impacts \citep{BanerjeeKarlanZinman2015, DuvendackMader2019, Meager2019} while asset grants (capital injection) remain to show high returns \citep{deMel2008, DeMel2014, FafchampsFlypaper2014, BandieraBRAC2017, BueraKaboskiShin2020}. \footnote{This is due partly to insufficient statistical power \citep{MckenzieWoodruff2013}. \citet{BanerjeeKarlanZinman2015} collects six studies of microfinance lending impacts. They also point the lack of statistical power due to low take up while noting more able and experienced borrowers saw larger ``transformative effects.'' %However, one must be careful with a low statistical power study as it naturally gives a way to erroneously large impacts. 
	In the current study, in contrast, the take up rate is relatively high at 74.42\%, of which 5.19\% is lost to the flood.  } Lack of mean impacts in microcredit led researchers to look for a particular subgroup which shows impacts, or impact heterogeneity \citep{Banerjee2017HyderabadFollowup}: Borrowers with prior experiences or high ability are shown to have higher returns \citep{Banerjee2015Miracle, Mckenzie2017Spurring, Banerjee2019MFPovertyTrap, BueraKaboskiShin2020}. These microfinance impact studies with a focus on experienced members or existing firms can be considered as looking at impacts on the intensive margins. In contrast, our study is focused on an isolated greenfield population which are relatively less studied.\footnote{Impacts on greenfield population is not the same as impacts on the extensive margins. Greenfield refers to a previously unserved population. Extensive margin refers to impacts on \textit{any} new borrowers, including those not in the previously unserved population. } 

	The fact that the experienced members gain larger benefits from microcredit is consistent with the positive impacts of capital grant programs on existing firm owners. Whether such experience is trainable for novice entrepreneurs remains unsettled. A recent microfinance study indicates that there is an advantageous selection through talents in the existing firm owners, so trainability is called into question \citep{Banerjee2019MFPovertyTrap}. A growing body of management capital literature in developing countries is insightful yet most of the research is necessarily geared to existing firms, so it does not inform much on how one can assist novice entrepreneurs.\footnote{\citet{BruhnKarlanSchoar2018} shows intensive management consulting services to the small scale firms in Mexico resulted in sustained improvements in management practices which led to higher TFP and larger employment. Others also show effectiveness \citep{Calderon2011, Berge2012, Bloometal2013} while others do not \citep{Bruhn2012, KarlanKnightUdry2015}. \citet{MckenzieWoodruff2013} put them as: These managerial impacts studies are too different to compare, in terms of population, interventions, measurement (variables, timing), and most importantly, implied statistical power in the design. \citet{McKenzie2021} summarises recent findings on the intensive margins. } \citet{KarlanValvidia2011, BruhnZia2011, Argent2014} are few exceptions, but results and quality of evidence are mixed and inconclusive. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Two other studies train novice entrepreneurs in Uganda and show large impacts. However, both programs bundle training with a cash grant and impacts cannot be estimated separately} \citep{Blattman2014, Blattmanetal2016}. The current study tests the marginal contribution of entrepreneurship in microfinance, on top of the impacts of lending, by comparing a heifer lending with a manegerial support program with cash lending. We also examine the self-selection on entrepreneurship into microfinance, which we find to exist.%Entrepreneurship and training components in the current study are to provide basic knowledge of dairy cattle production which can easily be written down. They, the cristalised intelligence, are outsourceable in nature. We consider it is the skills to deploy services in a timely manner, rather than the knowledge contents \textit{per se}, that we provide to help borrowers in increasing efficiency.


	The corporate finance devotes a substantial part of its field in understanding the consequences of contract designs on entrepreneur's incentives. \citet{Field2013} was the first to examine in the development context by experimentally allocating different types of debt contracts if the traditional lending style of microfinance inhibits the spawning of entrepreneurship.  %shows that a two-month grace period increases the investment size, raises profitability, but also increases the default rates. They discuss how it influences the investment riskiness that varies along risk preference heterogeneity. 	Compared to them, the experimental setting of the current study has a smaller investment opportunities that limits the scope of risk taking. 
	As we disscuss in the Section \ref{SecExperimentalDesign}, our study follows the similar strategy. In an attempt to tease out the impacts of entrepreneurship, we introduced longer maturity and a grace period in other arms. While there was a strong concern among practitioners that a grace period induces untruthful borrowing, there was no alternative in borrowing other than relatives and money lenders due to ruralness and isolation. This gave us flexibility in designing the debt contracts. Similar to \citet{Beaman2015} who redesigned the repayment schedule to adapt the borrower's cash flow profile (repay after harvest), we designed the debt contract to best suit the cash flow profile of the most popular investment project in the area, rearing a heifer. %Fortunately, our program ended with relatively low delinquency rates compared to other programs, and there is even suggestive evidence of repayment discipline among the borrowers. 
	Our study exemplifies the economic gains from designing the debt contract to match the presumed investment choices in microfinance.

	Another strand of the literature related to our study links capital grant effectiveness with the production set nonconvexity. Theories base lumpiness and credit market imperfection as keys to a povety trap \citep[e.g., ][]{GalorZeira1993}. When the production set is nonconvex, a small scale transfer may not lead to a sustained increase in income, as it can be either consumed or invested in a technology with inferior productivity that brings back to the original income level (i.e., the lower equilibrium of a poverty trap). 
	
	Despite its popularity as a theory, the empirical evidence of a poverty trap is mixed. \citet[][p.129]{KraayMcKenzie2014} note that a poverty trap finding is rare, while \citet[][p.321]{BarrettGargMcBride2016} state the otherwise and there is overwhelming evidence.\footnote{\citet{KraayMcKenzie2014} also note that upward transition from one poverty trap to another may negate the notion of a trap, while \citet{BarrettGargMcBride2016} base their affirmation by counting both the direct asset dynamics and the indirect inference that tests the behavioral responses that are consistent with poverty traps. See also \citet{CarterBarrett2006, BarrettCarter2013} for earlier evidence and discussions. } Interestingly, they both agree that, when there is a range of assets and production opportunities, it is inherently difficult to emipirically single out a particular poverty trap. The latter authors note that existing evidence comes mostly from remote and isolated areas with a single primary production opportunity and an associated asset. Our study is no exception. It comes from a remote and isolated area of northern Bangladesh where the single most important production opportunity to increase income in otherwise subsistence-oriented paddy producing villages is livestock production. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{In terms of poverty trap identification,} \citet[][Figure IV]{Balboni2020} \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{exemplifies a crucial point that large exogenous variations in assets are necessary to identify the existence of a poverty trap, because, observationally, the poor stays poor can be an outcome of a single low ability equilibrium. Our study also induces exogenous variations in asset levels through an experimental variation in debt contract design.}

	An earlier finding of a poverty trap includes the cattle herd size dynamics of Southern Ethiopian pastoralists that indicates existence of a poverty trap over a 17 year recall period \citep{Lybbertetal2004}. More recently, \citet{Balboni2020} estimate the equation of motion for assets and show the direct evidence of a poverty trap among the recipients of a large scale transfer program targeted in the neighbouring areas of our study site. The source of nonconvexity is cattle and the complimentary assets (vehicles) at the baseline which serve as a fixed input that the ultra poor cannot afford. Similar to these studies, our study examines the nonconvexity of a higher-return production set. Our study regresses the future asset values on the current asset values and intervention dummies, thereby adding evidence, in the \citet{BarrettGargMcBride2016}'s terminology, using the \textit{direct method}. %The estimation shows elevated returns to upfront liquidity, which is consistent with a poverty trap but does not constitute as direct evidence. So we turn to investment choices and find that the large upfront liquidity is mostly associated with a heifer purchase while the small upfront liquidity is associated with smaller livestock purchase and other small business trading which are known to have lower returns and higher risks, and only at a later point in time they acquire a heifer. 
	By complementing this estimated result with the fact that borrowers purchase cattle only when large upfront liquidity is provided, we conclude that there is a poverty trap. In our study, the source of nonconvexity is the price of a heifer that is about three times the price of a goat. We also show that the upfront liquidity is effective in escaping the poverty trap by showing large impacts on asset holding.

	Lastly, selecting the ultra poor as the population to provide supports have often involved free consultation/training and transfers in the past. A handful of studies on ultra poor transfer programs report sustained increase in assets and incomes \citep{Blattman2014, BanerjeeetalScience2015, Blattmanetal2016, HaushoferShapiro2016}. A transfer program in the Northern Bangladesh shows an occupational change and an income increase \citep{BandieraBRAC2017} and long-run asset accumulation \citep{Balboni2020}. %\citet{Kaboski2018Indivisibility} uses a lab-in-the-field experiment to show the link between investment indivisibility, saving, and patience. 
	In an attempt to examine commercial viability, our experimental design makes a reference to markets. It uses loans rather than transfers, and any training and consulting components charge a fee for service. The resulting repayment rates are not lower than the majority of representative microfinance programs, and we also find accumulation of assets. These results show that the costs of microfinance programs targeted to the ultra poor can be reduced by using loans and charging fees \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{at a competitive level}. Use of loans and fees can increase the likelihood of long run viability often overlooked in transfer programs.\label{PageOfCostsMFReduced} Our study lays a ground for market based interventions that can play a role in ultra poor programs.


\section{Background}
\label{SecBackground}


	The study area is in the river island, known as \textit{chars} in Bengali, of northern Bangladesh in Gaibandha and Kurigram districts. Chars are formed by sediments and silt depositions and are prone to cyclical river erosions and floods. Chars are not stable in size and even in existence, and episodes of their partial or complete erosion or submerging are common. Chars accommodate ultra-poor inhabitants who are forced, as a desperate attempt for survival, to relocate across islands due to river erosion and floods.

	In the study area, heifers are the prime investment choice. Female goats are considered to be a secondary choice by residents. A heifer needs to be at least two years old to start lactation.\footnote{They typically need to be about 15 months old to be ready for insemination and takes about 9.5 months to deliver a calf as it starts lactation, or the total of about 2 years. \label{heifer2years}} Rearing costs are higher for cattle as it requires fodder while a goat will eat the bushes. Cattle requires vaccination shots when a goat is usually left unvaccinated. Reproductive capacity of goats are high.\footnote{Parity size approaches to 2 at the third birth, and the birth interval is about 200 days \citep{Hasan2014goat}. An indigenous cow has a birth interval of 375 to 458 days \citep{Hasan2018}, resulting in about 2 years for gestation and calving interval \citep{Habib2012} with the mean lifetime births of 4 \citep[][Table 1]{Hasan2018}. We procure one year old heifers in our project to match the one year grace period with the two year gestation period. } However, in comparison with cattle, their higher reproductive capacity and lower rearing costs are more than offset by the elevated morbidity and mortality risks,\footnote{Indeed, morbidity of goat kids ranges from 12\% \citep{Mahmud2015} to more than 50\% in some diseases \citep[][Table 5]{Nandi2011}, while cattle morbidity is around 22\% \citep{Bangar2013}. Goat kid mortality ranges from 6\% \citep{Mahmud2015} to 30\% \citep[][Table 5]{Paul2014} \citep{Ershaduzzaman2007}. Heifer mortality is between 5\% \citep[][p.332R]{Hossain2014} to 10\% \citep{Alauddin2018}. Higher morbidity of goat kids partly reflects their eating style that uses lips rather than tongues (as cattles do) and vulnerability to logging water. } and a less frequent cash flow.\footnote{The produce of goats is mostly meat and their milk is seldom marketed. A meat market requires a cluster of relatively high income earners, usually located far from river islands, and the demand is highly seasonal. In contrast, cow milk can be marketed locally with stable demand, the lactation length is 227 days, and milk yield is 2.2 kg per day \citep{Rokonuzzaman2009}. } Residents also report that a goat herd is less mobile than single cattle when they are forced to evacuate during the flood. All of these considerations prompt residents to opt for cattle when they can afford it, and do not expand the herd size of goats, which are both confirmed in our data.

\vspace{2ex}
	In this section, we use a simplified version of \citet{GalorZeira1993} to illustrate a theoretical framework to aid the interpretation of the empirical finding that asset accumulation is faster while the repayment rate is higher for upfront lending. Let us consider that there are two production sets called `goats' and `cattle.' Both sets are nonconvex with fixed inputs as shown in \textsc{\small Figure \ref{fig poverty trap} (top panel)}. 
	In the top panel, the current period per capita asset size in monetary units $k_{t}$ is shown on the horizontal axis, the current period production in monetary units $y_{t}$ is shown on the vertical axis. For production set $j=\{\mbox{goats, cattle}\}$, the production becomes positive only after $k_{t}$ becomes greater than its fixed input portion $\underline{k}_{j}\in\mathbb R_{++}$.  The production after $\underline{k}_{j}$ follows a decreasing return to scale technology. 
	
	In the two bottom panels, period $t$ per capita asset size in monetary units $k_{t}$ is given on the horizontal axis and the period $t+1$ per capita asset size in monetary units $k_{t+1}$ is given on the vertical axis. We take cattle production as an example. In the bottom left panel, saving out of production is given by the dotted line $sf(k_{t})$ with a fixed saving rate $s\in(0, 1)$. Saving is zero for the flat segment, and becomes positive once the production becomes positive. For $k_{t}>\underline{k}_{\mbox{\scriptsize cattle}}$, the saving traces the cattle production set after rescaling with the saving rate $s$, or $sf(k)$. 
	
	The next period net per capita asset size is given by the sum of saving and carry over asset net of depreciation (including mortality) $(1-\delta)k_{t}$.  The depreciation rate $\delta\in(0, 1)$ is assumed to be constant. To keep the figure from being overly complicated, the depreciation rate is assumed to be common between the cattle and goat production. Carry over asset net of depreciation is given as the linear slope segment next to the origin. Once the production becomes positive, saving out of production is added to the linear carry over asset line, which forms an S-shaped line as depicted with a thick green line for goat and a thick blue line for cattle. 
	
	When cattle production is feasible in the long run, which we assume to be so, or when the thick blue line gets to pass the steady state line $k_{t+1}=k_{t}$, it will have two intersections, $C, M$. As shown in the bottom left figure, when the current asset level is greater than $k_{M}$, the asset level corresponding to the intersection $D$, the production eventually reaches $C$, a steady state where the per capita asset size is constant, or $k_{t+1}=k_{t}$. If the current asset level is smaller than $k_{M}$, the producer \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{eventually} will not choose to invest in cattle.

	Similarly for the goat production, there is much smaller fixed inputs and production, hence smaller saving $sg(k_{t})$. The shape of next period net per capita asset size is similar with the cattle, only smaller. We note from the previous section that the returns to goats net of mortality and the steady state goat asset size are smaller than the cattle in the region depicted in \textsc{\small Figure \ref{fig poverty trap}}. We also note that a goat investment, when compared to a cattle investment, requires smaller upfront costs but has an infrequent income stream, faces a more limited local demand, shows vulnerability to logging water, all pointing to smaller investments and their returns. We will use these points, and by neglecting risk implications, to assume that the fixed costs and steady state production level are smaller for goats than cattle.  

	For simplicity, we assume that all individual has an asset no smaller than $k_{B}$. Then, when there is only a goat production technology, individuals eventually reaches the point $G$. When the cattle production technology is added to the picture, there is no change in the equlibrium for individuals whose initial assets are in $[k_{B}, k_{M})$. For individuals with initial assets in $[k_{M}, \infty)$, one chooses cattle, because the resulting income level is higher, and eventually arrive at the steady state $C$.\footnote{$M$ is an unstable equilibrium that all individuals would deviate from, but we include this point to the region of attraction of $C$ for the sake of simplicity. } 

	Over the domain of $k_{t}\in[0, \infty)$, the production possibility frontier, or the contour of the union of two production sets, becomes M-shaped (\textsc{bottom right panel}). Under the configuration depicted in the figure, there will be five equilibria of which three are stable. Ruling out the zero equilbrium as irrelevant, one is left with two stable equilibria, named as goats and cattle in the figure.\footnote{A similar diagram is found in \citet[][Figure 3, with $k-y$ space]{KraayMcKenzie2014}. }$^{,}$ \footnote{Formally, one requires the production set $j=\{\mbox{goat, cattle}\}$ to satisfy: there exists $\underline{k}_{j}>0$ that the production is zero for input $k<\underline{k}_{j}$ and is strictly positive for $k\geqslant\underline{k}_{j}$. We assume the production set exhibits decreasing returns to scale for $k\geqslant\underline{k}_{j}$. Let the contour of the production set be $f_{j}(k)$. Assume for expositional simplcity that the saving rate $s$ and depreciation rate $\delta$ are fixed. Further assume that there exists $k_{M}>\underline{k}_{j}$ such that $sf_{j}(k)+(1-\delta)k>k$ for $k\in(k_{M}, k^{*})$, with $k^{*}>k_{M}$ is a fixed point $k^{*}=sf_{j}(k^{*})+(1-\delta)k^{*}$. For $k^{*}$ to be finite, under the assumption that cattle rearing is feasible so the intersection $C$ exists, we need $sf'_{j}(k^{*})+(1-\delta)<1$ which holds for any $s>0$ as long as the Inada condition $\lim\limits_{k_{t}\rightarrow \infty} f'(k_{t})=0$ is met. Under these assumptions, for $j$, there exists two intersections between the steady state line, one unstable and the other stable equilibria. }%$^{,}$ \footnote{In \textsc{Figure \ref{fig poverty trap}}, depreciation below $\underline{k}$ is not accounted, because capital cannot be negative. Once the production starts for $k>\underline{k}$, the contour shows net of depreciation so $sf(k)+(1-\delta)k$. } 

	In light of this argument, a loan that is larger than $k_{M}-k_{G}$ allows individuals in the goat equilibrium to transition to cattle production and arrive at the cattle equilibrium. The entire region depicted in the diagram is considered as in the realm of poverty, so it shows a poverty trap within poverty (i.e., goat as ultra poor and cattle as moderately poor). 

	A government lending can support the productive investments of borrowers without incurring an efficiencly loss. If the lender charges according to marginal costs, the interest rate is the same as the marginal return on capital $sf'(k_{C})+1-\delta$ or $sf'(k_{G})+1-\delta$. The slope of such interest rate is smaller than the marginal return on investment, which is the 45 degree line. Therefore, a lending, not a transfer, suffices for the transition, so long as the the loan size is no smaller than $k_{M}-k_{G}$ and if there is a way to reduce the costs of information asymmetry and transactions, for example, by group lending and an overhead cost subsidy.

	In the empirical section, we follow \citet{BandieraBRAC2017} in interpreting the lower repayment rates and smaller cattle holding for a smaller loan size as evidence consistent with a poverty trap with a nonconvex production technology. 

\section{Study sample}
\label{SecStudySample}

	Our sample is drawn from the population of river island villages in Northern Bangladesh. 
	\textcolor{red}{[Abu-san will provide the regional characteristics of the area, esp. poverty, using CLP/TUP program data and reports.]}
	
	In the \textit{char} region, the majority of \textit{char}s have only one village. The majority of \textit{char}s have no MFI activity, and we delisted the \textit{char}s if an MFI or an NGO is engaging in microfinance activies, or if \textit{Char Livelihood Program (CLP)} is active.\footnote{The \textit{Char Livelihood Program (CLP)} is run by DFID of the United Kingdom and transfers assets to the poor. } Using Landsat imagery, we identified 128 \textit{char}s within a day's boat ride from the Gaibandha peer and collected information by field visits. From this list of \textit{char}s, we randomly selected 80 \textit{char}s. In each village, we conducted a census of households with their wealth ranking made through a participatory ranking process. Following a process similar to the paired ranking as in \citet[][p.1212]{Alatas2012} and the Peruvian ultra poor case of \citet[][p.66]{KarlanThuysbaert2019}, we asked the least wealthy households in terms of asset ownership. We then asked to form a member committee of 20 households, of which 14 are ultra poor and six are moderately poor. The ultra poor are the poorest in the ranking, while the moderately poor are all other households. As we admitted households on a first come, first served basis, these 20 households are the first to join the membership of microfinance in respective poverty classes. After receiving acceptance for study participation (`pre-acceptance' in \textsc{\normalsize Figure \ref{fig experimantal design}}) from 80 groups comprising 1,600 members, baseline data was collected in 2012 prior to the debt contract type randomization. In each group, 10 out of 20 members were randomly offered the credit and the remaining members were kept as pure control groups who did not receive a loan until 1 or 2 years into the program. Due to a concern for within group spill overs, we do not use the subsample of these control members in this paper. We thus have 800 members for the impact evaluation of this paper whom we surveyed in the baseline and offered one of the four credit products. From these 800 members, we exclude 24 members whose intervention did not strictly follow the experimental design explained below.

	After the baseline data was collected in 2012, we offered the debt contracts to each group. There are four debt contract types that are randomised at the group level. After offering the each type of debt contract, three groups opted out as a group, resulting in 77 groups participating the intervention. In addition to the group level rejection, we had 89 individual loan rejectors before loan disbursements. This happened despite we had explained about the debt contract types, random assignment process, various other group based obligations, and had obtained everyone's consent to participate before randomisation. Although both types of rejecters refused to receive a loan, they gave a consent to be surveyed so we tracked them in subsequent survey rounds.



	In 2013, we lost four groups to floods. As they relocated, we had no choice but to drop them from the study. This resulted in 76 groups remaining in our data, including 4 groups who group-rejected the loans. In our study, attrition refers to dropouts from our household survey. Rejection refers to loan rejecters in our intervention, and majority of rejecters (81.25\%) did not attrit from our household survey. Counting all individual attriters, we have a total of 92 subjects (11.9\%) out of 776 subjects who attrited by the final round of the household survey. 

	As a result, among the baseline survey sample, there are flood victims whom we do not track, as well as group rejectors, individual rejectors and borrowers that we track. See \citet{GUK2016} for more details on the randomisation and acceptance process. We track all --- barring the flood victims whose villages were washed away and other attriters --- the potential borrowers in the data, including who eventually opted out the borrowing. This enables us to estimate the intention-to-treat effects of offering vrious debt contracts on the population who showed interests in joining microfinance membership.

	\textsc{\small Table \ref{tab DestatMainByArm}} shows descriptive statistics of sample households. As we randomly allocate them into four different arms named as \textsf{Traditional}, \textsf{Large}, \textsf{Large grace}, and \textsf{Cattle}, summary is shown by the arms and the overall. As shown in the Appendix \ref{AppSecRandomisation} \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab perm}}, these baseline household characteristics do not differ statistically between the arms, \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{except for production asset amount of \textsf{Large grace} arm being larger than other arms ($p$ value = 5.8\%).} Our sample is characterised by relatively low literacy rate (\textsf{HeadLiteracy}) and relatively young age (\textsf{HeadAge}) of the household heads. Literacy rate is lower than the national average of adult males at 61.54\% in 2012 (UNESCO). Household size (\textsf{HHsize}) is not large, 4.189 members overall, due probably to the constant flood threats, as indicated by above 49\% exposure overall at the baseline (\textsf{FloodInRd1}), that do not easily allow a large household formation. Cattle holding per household (\textsf{NumCows}) shows cattle rearing is not common and the mean herd size is between .2 to .4.\footnote{ \textsc{Table \ref{table anova CattleHoldingArm}} in Appendix \ref{AppSecRandomisation} shows the test results that \textsf{NumCows} do not differ across arms at the baseline. } Net asset value of household (\textsf{NetValue}) is a sum of the monetary value of livestock, household asset values (\textsf{HAssetAmount}), and productive asset values (\textsf{PAssetAmount}), less total indebted amount.\footnote{Debts include borrowing from relatives, friends, money lenders, NGOs, and the borrowing under the experiment. } The latter two differ to some extent by arms, but they mostly reflect sampling errors as indicated in the large standard deviations.\footnote{There is an alternative measure for net assets, which we call the broad net assets, in which, in addition to the regular asset items observed in all 4 rounds for household assets, we use all asset items. All estimation results hold with broad net assets with wider confidence intervals due to greater noises across time. See \textsc{Figure \ref{fig NetAssetsNetBroadAssetsNLAssetsCattleEffects}} for details. } The number of cattle holding (\textsf{NumCows}) indicates a low rate of cattle holding overall, and a large standard deviation indicates there are many zero holders. 

	\textsf{Attrited} indicates attrition rates in the household survey, and \textsf{GRejected} and \textsf{IRejected} show group rejection rates and individual rejection rates to the lending program. We analyse attrition and rejection in Section \ref{ResultsSectionParticipation}, \ref{SecAttrition}, but at this point, we just note that the attrition rates are not statistically different between the arms at the group level. \textsf{RiskPrefVal, TimePref1Val, TimePref2Val} are the minimum acceptable excess of risky options (vs. certainty), 3 month future options (vs. present), and 15 month future options (vs. 12 months in future), respectively, in monetary values. \label{StudySamplePrefDescription} Smaller values indicate greater risk torelance and patience. \textsf{PresentBias} is the ratio of respondents who indicate present biasedness, \textsf{TimePref1Val} $>$ \textsf{TimePref2Val}. All these measures are similar across arms in values, and also are similar statistically as shown in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab perm}} of Appendix \ref{AppSecRandomisation}.

	\item[T1]	Traditional microcredit. Members of the group receive 5600 BDT (approximately USD 50) credit, and the loan repayment begins two weeks after the disbursement. Members repay with weekly installments and are required to attend weekly meetings as well as to regularly save an amount decided jointly by the group members. The loan maturity is one year, and borrowers are unconditionally allowed to take another two loan contracts of equivalent amounts over the next consecutive years. The weekly repayment is 125 BDT (approximately USD 1.1) payable in 50 installments.
	\item[T2]	Upfront lumpy credit. Members receive 16,800 BDT (approximately USD 150) credit with a longer loan maturity, and the loan repayments begin two weeks after the disbursement. The weekly repayment and the design of compulsory saving are exactly the same as in \textsf{T1} arm. The loan maturity is three years. The required weekly repayment is 125 BDT payable in 150 weekly instalments. 
	\item[T3]	Upfront lumpy credit with a grace period. Members receive 16,800 BDT credit with loan repayments begin one year after the disbursement. During the first year grace period, members are required to meet weekly and follow group activities such as compulsory savings just as in other arms. The design of compulsory saving is the same as in the \textsf{T1}, \textsf{T2} arms. The loan maturity is three years. The required weekly repayment is 190 BDT (approximately USD 1.7) payable in 100 weekly installments, starting after one year.
	\item[T4]	In-kind credit with a one-year grace period and managerial support programs.\footnote{Heifer ownership was never explicitly agreed upon, but it was generally understood by the borrowers that they owned the heifer. T4 is thus more similar to a debt contract with the purchased asset as collateral than to a finance lease under which the asset ownership belongs to the lessor. } Members receive in-kind credit in the form of a one-year old heifer with the price of 16,000 BDT (approximately USD 142), and the loan repayments begin one year after the disbursement. The grace period length is equal to the one provided under \textsf{T3} and \textsf{T4} arms. In addition, the members receive input (fodder, veterinary and vaccination services) procurement supports, marketing consultancy (milk sales), and basic training on cattle rearing with the local NGO, at the total fee of 800 BDT (approximately USD 7.2) charged for the subscription period of three years. With 800 BDT for the support program, the total cost sums to BDT 16,800 which is the same as in all other arms.
	\end{description}

	One of the aims of the study is to assess if the entrepreneurship matters in microfinance lending outcomes. Assuming, below 17000 Taka, that the productive asset with the highest return is a heifer, we bundle training and consultation with a heifer lending. At the start of a loan, the NGO's procurement officer buys a heifer from the local market, so the borrower does not have to have the knowledge required for the quality purchase. By providing the knowledge to a group of borrowers through training and disallowing an investment choice with in-kind, heifer lending, some aspects of entrepreneurship will no longer be a prerequisite. It can be seen that we are offering a capacity to use the best practice or the \textit{cristalised intelligence} related to cattle production \citep{Cattell1963}. This is only a part of entrepreneurial skills. The remainder, a capacity to apply a suitable action to unforeseen events or the \textit{fluid intelligence} related to cattle production, and other inter-personal skills, are left unchanged. If the entrepreneurship raises productivity, borrowers of other arms who are not provided the knowledge are expected to opt out the loan more frequently or perform worse. One can measure effects of the entrepreneurship on participation and outcomes by comparing these two groups, in-kind credit with training vs. cash credit.

	As a natural reference, we want to compare the training cum in-kind loan \textsf{T4} with the traditional regular microcredit \textsf{T1}, a classic Grameen style loan that is about a third in loan size and maturity with no grace period. In order to make comparison less noisy, we added two intermediate treatment arms to bridge them: Two arms with upfront lumpy lending that is equivalent of a heifer price, one with a grace period \textsf{T3} and another without a grace period \textsf{T2}. With the loan sizes that are three times the traditional microfinance loans, we extended the maturity to three years to even out the repayment burden. The comparison arm, the traditional regular microcredit, has only one year maturity. We therefore provided the total of three loans in three loan cycles in \textsf{T1} which are unconditionally disbursed annually, so the total loaned amount will be aligned and there is no exit-selection due to delinquency before three cycles are complete. 
	
	Under this setting, upfront liquidity without changing the total loan size eases a liquidity constraint, attaching a grace period under the same loan size and disbursement timing eases a saving constraint prior to repayment, and offering an in-kind loan with a managerial support without changing other features eases an entrepreneurship constraint. In effect, we constructed a stepped-wedge design over these key features of loans, namely, upfront liquidity (\textsf{Upfront}), a grace period (\textsf{WithGrace}), and in-kind with managerial supports (\textsf{InKind}), to assess the impacts of respective constraints on participation and outcomes as indicated in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab factorial design}}. 
	
	An in-kind offer in treatment \textsf{T4} is generally thought to be less efficient than a cash offer as it takes away an investment choice from the borrower. However, the local microfinance practitioners and NGO members widely agree that other production opportunities are limited, so not much is lost in terms of the choice set, under our setting of island location.\footnote{A closely related project in the neighbouring areas transfers an asset in the form of a cow \citep{BandieraBRAC2017}. }  Given the small set of the productive investment choices, our experiment gives a unique chance to compare cash lending against in-kind lending, even without controlling for a potentially wider choice set of cash lending. 
	%It is generally thought in practice that an in-kind offer, with only a single asset to lease out, is less efficient than a cash offer as it takes away a choice from the borrower. However, the local microfinance practitioners widely agree that little is lost in a production opportunity even when the loan takes an in-kind form in a heifer, because a heifer is almost the only investment choice in our study area.\footnote{I is also notable that a closely related project in the neighbouring areas transfers an asset in the form of a cow\citep{BandieraBRAC2017}. } If this presumption is correct, it gives a unique chance to compare cash lending with in-kind lending, even without controlling for the different choice set of projects. In the later section examining the income generating activities, we show that this is actually the case.
	Indeed, we found in our data that most of \textsf{T2} and \textsf{T3} cash borrowers started to invest in cattle after receiving a loan. Consequently, in our study, the cash-grace-period and in-kind-grace-period lending differ effectively only in the managerial support services bundled in the latter. 

	All loan products are of individual liability and the committee was intended to serve only as an activity platform for microfinance operations. Among the \textsf{Traditional} members, there were 24 members who received disbursements twice, not three times, due to logistical limitations. We drop them from the analysis and use 776 members in the below. %\textcolor{red}{[Abu-san: Do you know why these 24 households received the loans twice, not three times? The answer is ``unknown.'' So we will just drop them from the analysis.]}

	Lastly, because of the severe flood damages caused on borrowers and the associated administrative delays in 2013, the repayment was halted in 2013 and resumed after one year in 2014. This resulted in an extension of loan maturity from 36 months to 48 months for all arms. This gave substantial leniency to the borrowers in terms of loan repayment burden.

\section{Empirical strategy}
\label{SecEmpiricalStrategy}


	We collected data at one baseline survey and three annual follow up surveys. With successful randomisation, we use ANCOVA estimators to measure impacts of each experimental arms and loan attributes. ANCOVA estimators are more efficient than DID estimators \citep{FrisonPocock1992, McKenzie2012}. As we include loan rejecters, what we are estimating is intention-to-treat effects. For an ease of interpretation, we sometimes use indicator variables of each attributes, \textsf{Upfront, WithGrace, InKind} in place of arms in estimating equations. Numerically, both are equivalent.\footnote{\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{From the discussions of \textsc{Table {\ref{tab factorial design}}}, using the expression in {\eqref{1steq}}, we know:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
b_{a_{\mbox{\scriptsize Large}}}&&\equiv b_{a_{1}}&=b_{a_{1'}}, \quad &&b_{a_{\mbox{\scriptsize Upfront}}}&&\equiv b_{a_{1'}}=b_{a_{1}}\\
b_{a_{\mbox{\scriptsize Large grace}}}&&\equiv b_{a_{2}}&=b_{a_{1'}}+b_{a_{2'}}, &&b_{a_{\mbox{\scriptsize WithGrace}}}&&\equiv b_{a_{2'}}=b_{a_{2}}-b_{a_{1}},\\
b_{a_{\mbox{\scriptsize Cattle}}}&&\equiv b_{a_{3}}&=b_{a_{1'}}+b_{a_{2'}}+b_{a_{3'}}, &&b_{a_{\mbox{\scriptsize InKind}}}&&\equiv b_{a_{3'}}=b_{a_{3}}-b_{a_{2}}.
\end{aligned}
\] } In what follows, we will refer to these attributes as \textit{functional attributes}.

	The estimating equation for our intention-to-treat effects is:
	\begin{equation}
	y_{it}=b_{1}y_{i1}+b_{a_{0}}+\bfb'\bfdee_{i}+e_{it}, \quad t=2, 3, 4,
	\label{1steq}
	\end{equation}
	where, for member $i$ in survey round $t$ ($t=1$ is the baseline), $y_{it}$ is an outcome measure, $\bfdee_{i}$ is a vector of three indicator variables in non-\textsf{Traditional} arms or functional attributes that $i$ receives, $\bfb'=\left(
	\begin{array}{ccc}
	b_{a_{1}} & b_{a_{2}} & b_{a_{3}}
	\end{array}
	\right)$ is associated impacts of the $k-$th arm $a_{k}$ relative to \textsf{Traditional} arm or functional attribute $a_{k'}$, $e_{it}$ is an error term. For the \textsf{Traditional} arm, the conditional mean of outcome given baseline outcome variable is given by $b_{a_{0}}$. For an arm $a_{k}$ or a functional attribute $a_{k'}$, the impact relative to the traditional arm is measured with $b_{a_{k}}$ or $b_{a_{k'}}$. In this section, we will only use $a_{k}$ for simplicity.

	As we are interested in the time course of relative impacts, we extend equation \eqref{1steq} as:
	\begin{equation}
	y_{it}=b_{1}y_{i1}+b_{a_{0}}+\bfb'_{}\bfdee_{i}+b_{3a_{0}}c_{3}+\bfb'_{3}\bfdee_{i}c_{3}+b_{4a_{0}}c_{4}+\bfb'_{4}\bfdee_{i}c_{4}+\bfgamma'\bfx_{it}+e_{it}, \quad t=2, 3, 4,
	\label{2ndeq}
	\end{equation}
	where $\bfb'_{t}=\left(
	\begin{array}{ccc}
	b_{ta_{1}} & b_{ta_{2}} & b_{ta_{3}}
	\end{array}
	\right)$ is a vector of time-varying impacts relative to concurrent \textsf{Traditional} arm in period $t=3, 4$, $c_{3}$ is a dummy variable for $t=3$ and $c_{4}$ is a dummy variable for $t=4$. $\bfb'_{}$ picks up impacts for $t=2$ for non-traditional arms. $\bfx_{it}=$ $\left(
	\begin{array}{ccc}
	\bfx'_{1it} & \bfx'_{2it} & x_{3it}
	\end{array}
	\right)'$ \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{is a vector of covariates consisting of $\bfx_{1it}, \bfx_{2it}, x_{3it}$. $\bfx_{1it}$ is a vector of baseline demographic characteristics, $\bfx_{2it}$ is a vector of previous cattle rearing experiences and their interactions with treatment arms, and $x_{3it}$ is number of owned cattle at the baseline. The regression specifications are: First is estimated without $\bfx_{it}$, second is estimated with $\bfx_{1it}$, third is estimated with $\bfx_{1it}, \bfx_{2it}$, fourth is estimated with $\bfx_{1it}, x_{3it}$, and fifth is estimated with $\bfx_{1it}, \bfx_{2it}, x_{3it}$. }\footnote{In outcomes that are not directly related to cattle rearing, we do not use previous cattle rearing experience and number of owned cattle at the baseline for covariates, so we only have specification 1 and 2. }

	Our main interest is on the time-varying impacts of $k$-th non-traditional arm relative to the traditional arm outcomes. In equation (2), this is captured by $b_{a_{k}}$ for period 2, $b_{a_{k}} + b_{3a_{k}}$ for period 3, and $b_{a_{k}} + b_{4a_{k}}$ for period 4. We plot these estimates for time-varying impacts using error bar charts in the next section. Given our sample is obtained by cluster sampling with clusters as chars, and intervention was randomised at the char level, all the standard errors are clustered at the char (group) level as suggested by \citet{AbadieAtheyImbensWooldridge2022}.%\footnote{To aid the understanding if the data is more suited to the assumption of first-difference (FD) rather than fixed-effects (FE), we use a check suggested by \citet[][10.71]{Wooldridge2010}. It is an AR(1) regression using FD residuals. Most of results show low autocorrelations in FD residuals which is consistent with the assumption of FD estimator. The issue of choice between FD or FE is not of primary importance, as the use of cluster-robust standard errors gives consistent estimates of SEs in both estimators, and it boils down to efficiency.  }

\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{One needs to be careful that, in the formulation of} \eqref{1steq} and \eqref{2ndeq} applied to functional attributes, \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{a grace period (saving constraint) and in-kind with managerial supports (entrepreneurial contsraint) are tested for its marginal impacts over other non-\textsf{Traditional} arm(s), where the latter is measured against the \textsf{Traditional} arm. In short, they are tested like null cross derivatives. The saving constraint is tested against the traditional microcredit lending on top of the impact of upfront liquidity, so it tests if its impact is different from the upfront impact which is measured relative to traditional mcirocredit lending. The entreprenuerial constraints are tested against the traditional microcredit lending on top of the combination of upfront liquidity and a grace period, so it tests if its impact is different from the sum of upfront impact and a grace period impact, whose sum is measured relative to traditional mcirocredit lending. In this way, saving and entrepreneurship constraints are not directly tested against the \textsf{Traditional} arm. Therefore, wheather the \textsf{Traditional} arm members faced these constraints, or whether these constraints exist in the study area, are not directly tested. To test a saving constraint in the study area, not its marginal contribution to upfront attribute impacts, one must have an arm with traditional microfinance with a grace period.\footnote{An arm with traditional microfinance with in-kind (heifer) and managerial supports cannot be constructed, because a heifer price is more than the lending amount. } This caveat applies only to functional attributes and non-\textsf{Traditional} arms are directly tested against the \textsf{Traditional} arm.}

	\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{In addition to outcome impact estimates, we also use permutation tests to examine the member differences by arm. A different debt contract design may attract individuals with different characteristics. The tests allow us to understand how the self-selected members differ by arm whom we base our impact inference. In Section }\ref{ResultsSectionParticipation}, \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{we show that the \textsf{Large} arm participants are richer in assets and cattle rearing experiences than other arms, and the \textsf{Cattle} arm participants are poorer in both respects. These give us clues when we interpret the impact estimates. }


\section{Results}
\label{SecResults}








	The reasons behind nonparticipation are fundamental in understanding the outreach. We will therefore analyse nonparticipation in relation to the debt contract design that they were randomly allocated to. We first examine the difference in characteristics of participants and rejecters, \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{and observe that rejecter characteristics differ between \textsf{Traditional} and non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. We argue it can result in underestimation of impacts.} Next, given our interests on the \textsf{Cattle} arm, we compare the participant characteristics of \textsf{Cattle} arm with other arms. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{We show that \textsf{Cattle} arm participants are poorer in terms of asset holding and have fewer cattle rearing experiences, both of which hint farther outreach.} Lastly, we compare the attriters' characteristics with the nonattriters' and \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{show that there is no selective attrition in our household surveys.} After these exercises, we assess the impacts of debt contract design on repayment, assets, labour incomes, consumption, and schooling. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{We show that the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms accumulate more net assets with higher repayment rates than the \textsf{Traditional} arm. In the robustness check, we confirm these results hold under various definitions of assets and across poverty class of borrowers. We also find some evidence that the ultra poor may have faced a challenge in repayment, therefore,  suggest an option of a longer saving period and/or a maturity.}


\subsection{Participation}
\label{ResultsSectionParticipation}


	As noted in Section \ref{SecExperimentalDesign}, there are two kinds of rejecters in participation. One is group rejecters who turned down the offer jointly as a group, and another is individual rejecters who decided not to participate while fellow members of the group participated. To examine the differences statistically, we use permutation tests of \textsf{R}'s \textsf{coin} package with 100000 random draws from all admissible permutations.

	We compare the group rejecters and group non-rejecters in the Appendix \ref{AppSecRejection}. We find that the asset-poor households group-rejected in the \textsf{Traditional} arm (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of group rejection among traditional arm}}), while it is younger, recent flood victims who group-rejected in the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of group rejection among non-traditional arm}}).  %Group rejecters of non-\textsf{Traditional} arms did not participate mostly because of negative asset shocks. This is a real resource constraint that binds the households. This is different from a psychological constraint that, so long as there is a cost or a payment involved, albeit at a minimal level, there remains a group of households who would not take up the investment \citep{Ashraf2010, CohenDupas2010}. 

	Given that all members reside on equally unstable river islands, we argue that flood shocks are random. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{If this is correct, the group rejection among non-\textsf{Traditional} arms will not affect estimates asymptotically.} To the extent that asset-poor households of the \textsf{Traditional} arm have non-larger returns due to their inability to invest in heiffers, their group rejection can result in inflated asset values whcich causes underestimation of impacts of non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. We consider that it is lack of \textsf{Upfront} liquidity that prevented asset-poor households of \textsf{Traditional} arm from participating because they cannot purchase cattle due to insufficient net asset values or an insufficient resale value of owned livestock, when members of similar characteristics partcipated in non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. 

	In the same way, we compare individual rejecters and individual non-rejecters for \textsf{Traditional} arm, non-\textsf{Traditional} arms, and all arms combined in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab MainTextIRjecters}}.\footnote{As shown in \textsc{Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of individual rejecters, traditional vs. non-traditional arm}}, characteristics of individual rejecters are similar between \textsf{Traditional} and non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. } \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{\textsf{Traditional arm} panel compares individual rejecters against non rejecters in the \textsf{Traditional} arm, \textsf{non-Traditional arm} panel shows the same comparison in the all non-\textsf{Traditional} arms combined, and \textsf{All arms} panel shows the comparison in the all arms combined. }

	As seen in \textsf{Livestock value, Number of cattle holding, Net asset value}, individual rejecters in both \textsf{Traditional} and non-\textsf{Traditional} subsamples tend to have less assets. While the differences between individual rejecters and non individual rejecters are not statistically meaningful due to small sample sizes in both subsamples, they become statistically unignorable when both subsamples are combined\footnote{For example, net asset values have $p$ values of 29.9\% and 13.1\% for both subsamples, which is reduced to 6.8\% in the all arms sample. }: In the \textsf{All arms} panel, the common factors associated with nonparticipation are a smaller household size ($p=1.3\%$) and smaller livestock holding ($p=9.3\%$).\footnote{\textsf{Flood at baseline} also has a small $p$ value but this arises only from the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. } The variable \textsf{Prop. of non-Trad arms} is the ratio of non-\textsf{Traditional} arm members in individual nonrejecters and individual rejecters and shows individual rejection rate is higher under the \textsf{Traditional} arm ($p=0.1\%$). %(\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of individual rejection among traditional arm}} and \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of individual rejection among non-traditional arm}}) \footnote{\textsf{Net asset value} also shows a difference which is due to a difference in \textsf{Livestock value}. } 

	% (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("l rejection$", TabLabel1)]}})
	%In non-\textsf{Traditional} arms, the individual rejecters have only marginally different mean values relative to individual nonrejecters (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab Ireject nontrad perm}}). 

	The smaller household size of rejecters hints that cattle rearing may require a certain household size. To interpret, small households may be facing a domestic labour constraint or a space limitation to accommodate cattle under the roof.\footnote{These constraints are expected to be absent in asset transfer programs where targeted residents can sell the asset if either of constraints binds. }$^{,}$ \footnote{Rejecters of non-\textsf{Traditional} arms have larger household size than the rejecters of \textsf{Traditional} arm. This result is consistent with the idea that the threshold of household size is higher than the \textsf{Traditional} arm because they invests more on cattle. } We conjecture that the households under a binding domestic capacity constraint did not meet the conditions to raise cattle, and have withheld themselves from the program with an individual rejection. This self-selection may have caused the repayment rates to be higher than when everyone participated. 

	One of the few differences between the two subsamples is flood exposure: It is related to individual rejection only among the non-\textsf{Traditional} arm members. %This is consistent with the conjecture that, had the \textsf{Traditional} arm group rejecters been offered any of the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms, they, as a group, may have accepted it.  %It shows the latter is more exposed to flood in baseline and has larger livestock values. This implies that, once large enough sum of loan is disbursed, %there is no minimum livestock and asset holding level to partake in the larger loans, and despite a negative asset shock in flood and a poverty trap at this level may be overcome once household size and negative asset shocks are accounted for.
	A strong correlation between baseline flood exposure and individual rejection among the non-\textsf{Traditional} arm members suggests that a population prone to natural calamity and associated asset shocks have voluntarily opted out the borrowing. This partly explains the lack of commercial and even noncommercial/NGO lenders in the flood prone areas. 
	
	\textsf{Risk preference value} indicates that individual rejecters tend to demand higher compensation for risks, and the $p$ value becomes small enough only with entire sample of \textsf{All arms}. This suggests some individual rejecters are more risk averse than non rejecters, \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{which is not surprising and validates our participation process being voluntary and free of strong peer pressures.} \textsf{Time preference value1, Time preference value2, Present bias} all do not show statistically recognisable differences. 

	In \textsc{\small Table \ref{tab main cownoncow}}, we compare if the \textsf{Cattle} arm participants (borrowers) differ from participants in other arms at the baseline. In the \textsf{Borrowers} panel, we compare all participants including attriters. \textsf{Non-attriting borrowers} panel compares the difference in non-attriting participant characteristics between \textsf{Cattle} and other arms. Non-attriting borrowers are borrowers who stayed in the household survey until the final round. 

	All partcipants of \textsf{Cattle} arm in the \textsf{Borrowers} panel differ from other arms in having less cattle rearing experience as observed in smaller initial cattle holding ($p$ value = 15.7\%) and in having lower net asset values ($p$ value = 2.8\%). Despite these disadvantageous features in rearing a heifer, the \textsf{Cattle} arm, which provides managerial supports and in-kind lending, induced partcipation.\footnote{\SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{\textsf{Household asset amount} is larger but the total asset \textsf{Net asset value} is smaller in the \textsf{Cattle} arm. We also note \textsf{Cattle} arm borrowers show relative impatience as indicated in \textsf{TimePrefVal1} ($p$ value = 0.6\%), \textsf{TimePrefVal2} ($p$ value = 4.4\%). There is a chance that individuals with a weaker preference to save may have participated in \textsf{Cattle} arm.} } As we will see in Section \ref{Sec Impacts}, the choice of lending instrument (cash or in-kind) does not matter in the investment choice. So it is natural to infer that the managerial support component has induced the members with less experiences and fewer assets to take up loans. 

	The \textsf{Non-attriting borrowers} examined in the right panel can be seen as successful borrowers. At the baseline, these successful borrowers of \textsf{Cattle} arm have smaller baseline livestock holding ($p$ value = 1.7\%) and smaller baseline net asset holding ($p$ value = 1.5\%) than other arms' successful borrowers. %(\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{}})
This hints that asset-poor, less experienced borrowers participated and managed to stay on the survey until the end of the study in the \textsf{Cattle} arm with a help of managerial supports. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{Combining the two panels indicates that the \textsf{Cattle} arm resulted in outreach to asset-poor households from the beginning to the end of the project.} 

	%	Group level rejection to participate is negatively correlated with literacy of household head (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab Greject perm MainText}}). Acknowledging the reasons for rejection can be different for individuals, we also tested the independence of each characteristics for individual rejecters (vs. non-individual rejecters) in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab Ireject perm MainText}}. One sees that smaller \textsf{HHsize}, being affected with \textsf{FloodInRd1}, and smaller \textsf{LivestockValues} and \textsf{NumCows} are associated with individual rejecters. We conjecture that individual decisions not to participate may be understood as: Smaller household size leaves a smaller capacity for cattle production labour in a household, and being hit with a flood may have resulted in lower livestock levels that would prompt them to reconsider partaking in another livestock project. 
%
%	A closer look at the nonparticipation correlates among \textsf{Traditional} arm members in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab reject trad perm MainText}} and non-\textsf{Traditional} arm members in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab reject nontrad perm MainText}} reveals possible differences in the causes. Rejection among \textsf{Traditional} members tend to be associated with lower livestock holding but not with higher flood exposure nor smaller household size, while rejecters among non-\textsf{Traditional} members are more likely to have suffered from flood at the baseline and have smaller household size. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab reject trad nontrad perm MainText}} shows rejecters of \textsf{Traditional} have less flood exposure, smaller livestock and cattle holding, but not necessarily poorer as indicated by head literacy and asset holding than non-\textsf{Traditional} counterpart. Given \textsf{Traditional} rejecters at the mean have smaller livestock while household size is similar, it hints some capacity to supply labour for cattle production if an opportunity arises.

%	Since the offered arms were randomised, individual rejecters of \textsf{Traditional} arm, who are similar in characteristcs to individual rejecters of non-\textsf{Traditional} arm whose impediments are baseline flood and small household size, may have accepted the offer had their household size is larger and had they been offered non-\textsf{Traditional} lending. Henceforth, we conjecture that flood exposure and household size are the potential impediments for uptake in larger size loans. 


	%Even we are targeting the ultra poor and designed the loan products to help them rise above the poverty trap, we still find lacking minimum level of assets, despite at a very low level, had kept the ultra poor from participating in microfinance. In the results of lending we consider in the below, the bottom class of the ultra poor had not lept its benefits.

\subsection{Attrition}
\label{SecAttrition}

	The survey resulted in the attrition (including the flood victims) of a moderate rate, 11.9\%. We checked for systematic differences between attriters and nonattriters 
	%\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[1]}}.
	and found the attrition is not correlated with any household level characteristics (see more detailed attrition examination in Appendix \ref{AppSecAttrition}). %As attrition 	rates differ between \textsf{Traditional} and non-\textsf{Traditional} arms, we %compare them %in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of attriters of traditional and non-traditional arms}}. It shows 
	We also found that \textsf{Traditional} arm attriters have a lower rate of head literacy while non-\textsf{Traditional} arm attriters have a higher rate of head literacy, are more exposed to the flood and have a larger household size. One can argue that, if the household head's literacy is positively correlated with economic impacts of borrowing, the impacts of borrowing \textit{under no attrition} could have been smaller for the \textsf{Traditional} arm and larger for the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. As we assume that the flood damage is random, these considerations of sample attrition hint that there can be underestimation, if any, \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{because of possible overestimation of the \textsf{Traditional} arm and possible underestimatoin of the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms.}

\end{figure}

	In \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssets}}, we show the time paths of net assets by arm in logarithms. Overall, we see increased levels of asset holding in all arms. We see bifercation of net asset holding into large and small values in all arms. At the start of the program, the majority is the small holders in all arms. As periods progress, we see large holders become the majority group in non-\textsf{Traditional} arms while the substantial small holders remain in the \textsf{Traditional} arm. The difference between \textsf{Traditional} arm and non-\textsf{Traditional} arms are visually subtle and one must use statistical tests to examine differences. %\footnote{In all regressions, specification (1) is an OLS on arms/functional attributes, (2) is ANCOVA only with arms/functional attributes, (3) adds flood exposure, household head characteristics, household size to (2), (4) adds baseline cattle ownership and interactions to (3), (5) addes baseline cattle holding to (3), (6) adds adds baseline cattle ownership and interactions and baseline cattle holding to (3). } 

	\textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetEffects}} summarises the time-varying impacts on net assets using the equation \eqref{2ndeq}.  See \textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA narrow net assets timevarying}}, \textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA narrow net assets timevarying attributes}} of Appendix \ref{AppendixEstimationTables} for full estimation results. Points are the estimates and vertical bars are 95\% confidence intervals using clustered standard errors. For all panels, in each period, there are five estimation specifications bunched side-by-side. This is intended to show the robustness to specification changes at a glance.\footnote{As multiple specifications are estimated to show uniformity of results, not to pick one specific estimate, inference corrections for multiple testing are unncessary. } One sees that there is little variation across specifications. %Cattle and net assets have more regression specifications due to their possible dependence on previous cattle ownership and its inclusion as a covariate.
	
	There are three columns of arms on left, and two columns of functional attributes on right. Since \textsf{Large} arm and \textsf{Upfront} functional attribute are numerically the same in \eqref{2ndeq}, they are put in one panel column. The left group panel under \textsf{Arms} shows the deviation from concurrent \textsf{Traditional} arm values, or how much the impacts relative to \textsf{Traditional} arm have evolved over time. In the right group panel under \textsf{Functional attributes}, \textsf{With grace} shows impacts relative to \textsf{Upfront}, and \textsf{In Kind} shows impacts relative to \textsf{Upfront} plus \textsf{With grace}. 

	There are three notable findings from the figure. First, point estimates show that all the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms have increased net assets over time relative to the \textsf{Traditional} arm. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Time course of impacts may differ, however, all achieve similar impacts in period 4. Note also that the confidence intervals are narrowest in the \textsf{Cattle} arm. Given the sample size is the same, this hints that the \textsf{Cattle} arm may have contents that reduce the variations in asset returns relative to other functional attributes.}

	 %Estimates for net assets of \textsf{Traditional} arm show an upward trend. On top of this underlying trend, all non-\textsf{Traditional} arms show a one-time increase, or a gap relative to \textsf{Traditional} due to the \textsf{Upfront} aspect of lending. \gobblepars

Second, it is the \textsf{Upfront} functional attribute that shows positive impacts on the net assets. This is consistent with the nonconvex production technology with fixed costs under a liquidity constraint, coupled with an inferior, smaller fixed cost production technology. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA narrow net assets timevarying}} [specification (2)] in the Appendix shows that, relative to the traditional microfinance lending, the upfront liquidity provision increases the net assets by BDT 
	18783 
	[CI 8577, 28988] or 1.15$\sigma$ (of the baseline standard deviation) by the fourth year ($p$ value=0.03\%). The grace period and in-kind loan with managerial supports do not add any marginal impacts beyond the upfront functional attribute 
(-2044 [CI -15109, 11022] or -0.13$\sigma$, $p$ value=75.90\% for grace period, 
-3077 [CI -13804, 7651] or -0.19$\sigma$, $p$ value=57.38 for in-kind and managerial supports) 
by the fourth year. 
	%and the number of cattle holding by round(confi[grepl("NumCows$", FileName) & grepl("cum", ImpactType) & grepl("ge$", attributes) & grepl("T$", regtype) & num == 2 & period == 2,  estimate], 2) (CI round(confi[grepl("NumCows$", FileName) & grepl("cum", ImpactType) & grepl("ge$", attributes) & grepl("T$", regtype) & num == 2 & period == 2,  .(lb, ub)], 2)) or round((confi[grepl("NumCows$", FileName) & grepl("cum", ImpactType) & grepl("ge$", attributes) & grepl("T$", regtype) & num == 2 & period == 2,  estimate]/NumCowsSummary["stdNumCow"]), 2)$\sigma$ in the second year, and round(confi[grepl("NumCows$", FileName) & grepl("cum", ImpactType) & grepl("ge$", attributes) & grepl("T$", regtype) & num == 2 & period == 4,  estimate], 2) 	(CI round(confi[grepl("NumCows$", FileName) & grepl("cum", ImpactType) & grepl("ge$", attributes) & grepl("T$", regtype) & num == 2 & period == 4,  .(lb, ub)], 2)) or round((confi[grepl("NumCows$", FileName) & grepl("cum", ImpactType) & grepl("ge$", attributes) & grepl("T$", regtype) & num == 2 & period == 4,  estimate]/NumCowsSummary["stdNumCow"]), 2)$\sigma$ by the end of fourth year. 
	As we discuss in the robustness checks, these results hold when other various definitions of assets are adopted or other covariates are controlled for, including cattle rearing experiences.

	Third, while \textsf{InKind} panel shows its marginal contribution is negative, it is statistically zero. The finding that the \textsf{Cattle} arm outcomes are statistically indistinguishable from other non-\textsf{Traditional} arms implies that it facilitated the returns to cattle rearing at a no lower level. In light of the fact that individuals with less cattle rearing experiences and lower asset values participated and continued in the \textsf{Cattle} arm, the returns at a no lower level by themselves are an achievement. %The \textsf{Cattle} arm have induced participation to lending and have achieved the same level of impacts as in other arms, on the members who would otherwise not take a loan because of their relatively disadvantaged background characteristics. 

	\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{We interpret this as evidence of no entrepreneurship constraint once the borrowng is made. This is consisitent with the finding by previous studies that, on the greenfield population who had not been exposed to microfinance services, the returns are high across the board and there is no evidence of negative nor positive returns on skills in microfinance.} %Previous studies on the intensive margins who had been using microfinance cited in the Section \ref{SecIntroduction} have targeted the population with a richer set of investment possibilities in a more urbanised setting under which the experience may have a positive return. 
In the current study, the population resides in a remote, rural area. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{This is not to imply that entrepreneurship has no role to play. As we saw in} Section \ref{ResultsSectionParticipation}, \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{in terms of participation, supporting entrepreneurship may matter.} Even the simpler production process of cattle rearing that consists of procuring feeds, grazing, insemination and calving turns out to demand unignorable codifiable skills or the crystalised intelligence for the asset-poor to participate. We show the returns to experience have not affected the outcomes in more details in \ref{subsec RobustnessCheck}.\footnote{An alternative interpretation is that the smaller variations of impacts, not the codifiable skills or managerial support programs \textit{per se}, among \textsf{Cattle} arm borrowers mentioned earlier can induce more risk averse individuals to participate. Under this self-selection process, we should end up with more risk averse individuals in \textsf{Cattle} arm. However, this is not the case as participants of \textsf{Cattle} and other arms do not differ in what is measured by \textsf{Riks preference value}. }

	One of the reasons behind the difference in net asset impacts of non-\textsf{Traditional} arms relative to \textsf{Traditional} arm is the number of cattle holding. In \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetsNetBroadAssetsNLAssetsCattleEffects}}, we show the impacts on the subcomponents of net assets. The \textsf{Cattle (counts)} row shows the impacts on number of cattle owned\footnote{This also serves as a check that non-\textsf{Traditional} members actually own cattle once the loan is made, which is affrimative in all arms. }$^{,}$\footnote{The ANCOVA estimates plotted in the figure are net of baseline cattle holding, so even the non-traditional holding estimates sometimes add up to less than 1. }%As shown in column (1) of \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA cow time varying}}, both \textsf{Traditional} arm and the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms increase the cattle ownership. 
	The figure shows that, on average, the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms continue to own about .4 more cattle than the \textsf{Traditional} arm members conditional on the initial cattle holding, although estimates are indistinguishable from zero for some arms and regression specifications. In the row of \textsf{Net non-livestock assets}, a similar pattern is found and non-\textsf{Traditional} arms accumulate about 5000 BDT larger net non-livestock assets (3830 BDT [1472, 6187] for \textsf{Large}, 6057 BDT [3579, 8535] for \textsf{Large grace}, 4856 BDT [2559, 7154] for \textsf{Cattle}) than the \textsf{Traditional} arm by period 4. 

	To gain insights on larger cattle holding among the non-\textsf{Traditional} members, we decompose the cattle ownership of each arms in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig CattleHoldingArm}}. Holder rates (\textsf{HolderRates}) are the number of cattle owners per arm size, holding size (\textsf{HoldingSize}) is average holding per owner, initial owners' holding (\textsf{InitalOwnerHolding}) are herd size in each period of owners who held cattle at baseline, and per capita holding (\textsf{PerCapitaHolding}) is mean cattle holding in each arm. Initial owner holding and holder rates reflect impacts on the intensive and extensive margins, respectively. Per capita holding tracks impacts on both the intensive margins (growth of initial owners) and the extensive margins (growth of new owners). All the indicators are similar across arms at the baseline. 
	
	We see that the holder rates increased, or the extensive margin ``impacts'' were positive, in all arms, although the increase was smallest for the \textsf{Traditional}.\footnote{To be precise, increases of cattle holding is not an impact estimate, so we are abusing the terminology. } This shows that, even the small upfront lending of \textsf{Traditional} arm helped increase catte ownership but to a lesser degree. With no large upfront liquidity provision and the repayment pressure that begins immediately after the disbursement, a smaller fraction of borrowers could purchase their first cattle. \textsf{HoldingSize} increased in all non-\textsf{Traditional} arms, while the \textsf{Traditional} arm remained stagnant. In \textsf{InitialOwnerHolding}, it is also the \textsf{Traditional} arm that has the smallest, or negligible, changes between round 1 and 4. For the non-\textsf{Traditional} arm, \textsf{InitialOwnerHolding} size is larger than the average holding size per owner, hinting the higher returns to members with experiences, or on the intensive margins. However, as we see in Section \ref{subsec RobustnessCheck}, this conjecture is not supported in a formal test of return to cattle ownership at baseline. The per capita holding growth was smallest in the \textsf{Traditional} arm. This is due to smaller changes on the extensive margins (fewer new ownership, smaller growth by new owners) and little change on the intensive margins (negligible growth by initial owners). 

	%One also sees that about 79\% of \textsf{Traditional} arm members own cattle in period 2. This indicates that even a small loan helped some borrower to increase cattle ownership, but to a smaller magnitude than in the non-\textsf{Traditional} arm.

	To understand the reasons behind the slower pace of asset accumulation of \textsf{Traditional} arm,
 % in \textsc{\small Figure \ref{fig AllIGAChoices}}, we plot borrower's reported income generating activities (IGAs) separately by the total number of projects that the borrowers report. Contents of IGAs are cattle, goat/sheep, growing cereals (paddy, corn) and nuts, small trades, and house and land leasing. The row panel headed by the number `1' indicates the distribution of projects among single-project owners, `2' indicates the distribution among double-project owners, and so on. This shows that almost no one of the \textsf{Traditional} arm invested only in one project while only few members did so in the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms. We also note that there are a significant number of cases in the \textsf{Traditional} arm that members reportedly raise cattle, yet they are also accompanied by pararell projects in smaller livestock production and small trades. Popularity of small trades and smaller livestock for the \textsf{Traditional} arm members is consistent with convexity in the production technology of large domestic animals under a liquidity constraint. This also validates our supposition in experimental design that cattle production is the most preferred and probably the only economically viable investment choice. It eases a concern that the \textsf{Cattle} arm may have imposed an unnecessary restriction in an investment choice by forcing to receive a heifer. 
in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig FirstIGAChoicesCattleVsOther}}, we plot the contents of first IGAs of members. The first IGA is defined as the oldest IGA for the household. For most of the households, the oldest IGA had started after the baseline, and it is the IGA with the largest cash flow. Of course, there is a small percentage of households with an existing IGA before the baseline, but, with randomisation, the fraction of such households are similar across arms. Therefore, the between arm comparison of the first IGA gives us an idea about how the households had chosen the initial investments. 
In the \textsf{Traditional} arm, there are 33 borrowing members (30.28\%) who report cattle as their first IGA, and 76 borrowing members (69.72\%) who report other than cattle as their first IGA. 
This contrasts with the non-\textsf{Traditional} arms that 466 borrowing members (94.91\%)
who report cattle as their first IGA and 25 borrowing members (5.09\%) other than cattle as their first IGA. 
Correspondingly, the data confirms that the \textsf{Traditional} arm borrowers hold a diversified IGA portfolio while only a small minority of non-\textsf{Traditional} arm borrowers have a diversified portfolio.\footnote{As observed earlier, a stagnant growth of \textsf{InitialOownerHolding} indicates the \textsf{Traditional} arm initial owners diversified their portfolio rather than increasing the cattle investments. }  \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{One may wonder why so little of \textsf{Traditional} members invested in cattle. This may be due to our experiment design that requires them to start repay immediately after the loan disbursement, so they did not have an option to save the cash for three years to invest in a heifer.}

\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{The results of \textsf{WithGrace} panel in} \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetEffects}} \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{show that the saving constraint is not binding. We note that this only tells that it did not bind additionally on top of \textsf{Upfront} functional attribute, and does not directly speak to the constraint faced by \textsf{Traditional} arm. The fact that the \textsf{Traditional} arm members invested in smaller assets or smaller trades hints that the saving constraint was binding for them before the program began. The puzzle that the \textsf{Large} arm members, who were also asked to repay immediately, invested in cattle can be understood by the difference in self-selection process. At the baseline, \textsf{Large} arm's household size is larger, cattle owner rate is higher, and net asset values are greater (see }\textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab DestatMainByArm}}\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{), all of which indicate wealthier individuals who might have cash for repayment. Although their $p$ values are all large} (\textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab perm}}), \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{one may still speculate if the less wealthy individuals could have invested in a heifer without a grace period}.

	\textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig IncomeConsumptionEffects}} shows impacts on per capita expenditure of the household\footnote{Consumption is based on the annualised expenditure on following items: rice, wheat, maize, potato, lentil, other pulses, other staples, chicken, other meat, fish, milk, egg, chili, stem, carrot, leafy vegetable, other vegetable, banana, seasonal fruits, other fruit, puffed rice, onion, pgarlic, ginger, oil, sugar, salt, hard spices, soft spices, tea, bettle, other drinks, biscuit, cigarette, chew tobacco, transport, fuel wood, cloth, soap, haircut, cosmetic, communication, festivities, mosque related, contraceptive, wedding/funeral, other.

Labour income impacts use the ANCOVA estimator.\footnote{Changes in \textsf{per capita consumption} is considered unrelated to baseline cattle ownership under our assumption, so only two regression specifications are reported. Other specification results are similar and are available from authors. Baseline cattle ownership may be related to changes in \textsf{labour income} when baseline cattle ownership brings in heterogenous returns on investments that change the cashflow to the household, so all specifications are estimated. }} %Instead, using period 2 consumption as a reference point, we can understand how the members have dealt with the loan repayment through consumption choices. %Given randomisation, one can still identify impacts on repayment efforts in terms of consumption suppression relative to the \textsf{Traditional} arm although we may lose estimation efficiency. 

	Consumption does not seem to be particularly different between all arms. Labour incomes also do not show any impact by the arm relative to the \textsf{Traditional} arm. These imply that the borrowing and its repayment do not seem to affect the household welfare in terms of consumption, nor the repayment efforts as measured by earned labour incomes. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{As the wealth effects of asset accumulation and the repayment pressure work in the oppositte directions on consumption, this may not be a surprising result. No impacts on labour incomes are also not surprising. There are only a limited number of casual jobs on the river islands, and jobs on mainland are less lucrative due to costs of boat ride and commuting time.} These, at least, suggest that the borrowers of non-\textsf{Traditional} arm are not under an extra heavy repayment burden relative to the borrowers of \textsf{Traditional} arm.

\end{tabular}
}
\end{figure}

	To understand the welfare levels, in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig MeanOutcomes}}, we plot the mean consumption and incomes by arm and period. We see that, in all arms, per capita consumption in period 3 and 4 increased relative to period 2. Given this is also observed in the \textsf{Traditional} arm, we do not detect marked difference relative to it in OLS. The labour incomes are increasing from period 3. Non increasing per capita consumption between periods 3 and 4 despite the growth in labour incomes suggest that households seem to have put asset accumulation and repayment a priority before consumption growth.\footnote{One notes that the labour income both in per capita or household total are lowest in period 2 for all non-\textsf{Traditional} arms, second lowest for the \textsf{Traditional} arm, and start increasing from period 3. The fall in period 2 income is due to the floods as the demand for labour plummeted. Similarly, NGO members suggest that period 2 consumption is lower than period 3 and 4 because of flood damages. }  %As labour income growths and steady consumption are uniformly observed, it is accrued to the loan and its repayment, not to the functional attributes. 
It just does not show up in the impact estimates because members of all arms are behaving the same way. This also indicates that the borrowers did not choose to strategically default but tried to repay. 

\subsubsection{Repayments}

\begin{table}
\hfil\textsc{\footnotesize Figure \refstepcounter{figure}\thefigure: Cumulative weekly net repayment rates\label{fig weeklysavingrepayrate}}\\

\hfil\begin{tabular}{>{\hfill\scriptsize}p{1cm}<{}>{\scriptsize}p{12cm}<{\hfill}}
Note:& Each dot represents weekly observations. Only members who received loans are shown. Each panel shows ratios of cumulative repayment against cumulative due amount, sum of cumulative repayment and cumulative net saving (saving - withdrawal) against cumulative due amount, against weeks after first disbursement. Lines are smoothed lines with a penalized cubic regression spline in \textsf{ggplot2::geom\_smooth} function, originally from \textsf{mgcv::gam} with \textsf{bs=`cs'}. \\[-1ex]
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



	\textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig weeklysavingrepayrate}} shows the repayment results. Top panel shows the ratios of cumulative repayment to cumulative planned installment, the bottom panel further adds the cumulative net saving (saving - withdrawal) to the numerator to indicate the total cash amount in the member's account. Both are plotted against weeks after first disbursement. Each dot represents a member at each time point. Value of 1, which is given by a horizontal line, indicates the member is at per with repayment schedule. Some members repaid or saved more than the required amount that go beyond 1 in the figure. One sees that the repayment rates are above 1 at the beginning but stay below 1 for most of the time. The majority of borrowing members did not repay the loan by the 48th month with prespecified installments. One notes the \textsf{Traditional} arm has more of lower repayment rates among all arms. 
	
	When a member does not reach the due amount with installments, they had to repay from the (net) saving, an arrangement to which the lender and the borrowers made at the loan contract signment. Repayment rates at the end of period 4 after using net saving are 44.71, 93.57, 97.01, 95.42\%, respectively, for \textsf{traditional, large, large grace, cow} arms, 87.85\% for overall, and 95.32\% for the average of non-\textsf{Traditional} lending arms. %(from \textsf{\footnotesize AllMeetingsRepaymentInitialSample.rds}). 
	The overall repayment rate is comparable to the two microfinance programs with repayment rate information 74\% and 99\% examined in \citet{BanerjeeKarlanZinman2015}, and the non-\textsf{Traditional} lending has exceptionally high repayment rates. The low repayment rates among \textsf{Traditional} arm borrowers may be due to our experimental design that a new loan is disbursed unconditionally up to three cycles, lacking the dynamic incentives to repay, or due to the fact that they had lower returns on their investments. Our finding of growing labour incomes and the steady consumption levels in the subsection \ref{subsubsection ConsumptionIncomeEffects} indicates the latter possibility is more likely. 

	There is little difference in repayment rates by poverty class. \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig weeklysavingrepayrate}} depicts both moderately poor and ultra poor in different colours. It is impossible to distinguish between them with eyeballs, and ANCOVA estimates on repayment and repayment shortfall also confirms this  (see Appendix \ref{Sec App Repay}, \textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA Repayment poverty}, \ref{tab shortfall indiv o800}} for details). \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Permutation tests also confirm that cumulative shortfall of repayment relative to cumulative planned installments are similar between the ultra poor and the moderately poor} ($p$ value=68.16\%, 34.11\%, 41.95\%, 35.28\% for loan year 1, 2, 3, and 4, see \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab perm repay by poverty}}). 

	Smaller cumulative impacts and lower repayment rates of \textsf{Traditional} arm members stand out once we acknowledge that they are receiving an equivalent amount and their contract differs with other arms only in the functional attributes we focus on. These differences arise partly from the different investment choices observed in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig FirstIGAChoicesCattleVsOther}}, which were induced mostly by the lack of \textsf{Upfront} functional attribute in lending.

\end{figure}

	In Section \ref{ResultsSectionParticipation}, we observed that nonparticipation is correlated with smaller household size. If the household size limits the participation to microfinance, we may observe adverse impacts of borrowing on the children's school enrollment. In \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig SchoolingEffects}}, the effects on child school enrollment are displayed. Unlike the previous figures, we show per period impacts relative to the concurrent \textsf{Traditional} arm values. \footnote{We chose to show per period impacts because annual enrollment status matters in schooling. Using estimated parameters of \eqref{2ndeq}, what we display in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig SchoolingEffects}} are the per period impacts ($\bfb_{3k}$ for period 3 and $\bfb_{4k}$ for period 4), not the cumulative impacts ($\bfb_{2k}+\bfb_{3k}$ for period 3 and $\bfb_{2k}+\bfb_{4k}$ for period 4). Results are less pronounced under time-varying impact estimates and \textsf{WithGrace} and \textsf{InKind} have positive impacts. This may be that having a grace period allows households to hire labour, in place of sons, for cattle rearing. See \textsc{Figure \ref{fig SchoolingEffectsWithTradByFunAttribute}} and \textsc{Figure \ref{fig SchoolingEffectsWithTradByArm}} in Appendix \ref{AppendixEstimationTables}. } 



	\SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{There is a possible negative impact for boys at the primary level in period 3 and 4 with the \textsf{Upfront} functional attribute. Point estimates on boys are mostly negative for other school levels with this functional atttribute, yet none of them are precisely estimated. Estimates on girls switch signs across specifications and arms. They have wider CIs than boys that include zero in their CIs, so they are incoherent, but a few estimates have reasonablly low $p$ values.} Negative impacts of boy's schooling may be due to a stronger household labor demand derived from increased cattle production in a household. This is in line with the finding in program rejection that the limited household size can be a constraint on participation. Cattle ownership naturally shifts the relative shadow prices in a household against child schooling, and the cattle rearing tasks are not so brawn intensive enough that even the primary school aged boys can handle. This may be a potential downside of having greater cattle production in a household. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{The estimated impacts on primary school aged boys range from -9 to -8 percentage points, which amounts to -10.5 to -9.3 percent of the period 4 mean enrollment rate of \textsf{Traditional} arm students at 83 percent.}

\subsubsection{Summary of impacts}

	In summary, we found that our managerial support programs induce the members of disadvantaged background to participate in microfinance, achieving the farther outreach, and have the impacts that are no different with other borrowers. We also found their repayment rate is comparable with other treated arms and are higher than the regular microcredit arm. This is consistent with the finding of the previous studies that a certain level of skills is necessary for participation, and our managerial support progams supplemented the lack thereof. We found that the large upfront disbursement allows borrowers to invest in cattle while members with sequential disbursements mostly opted for smaller livestock and small trades. In combination with a greater return to cattle measured by net asset accumulation and a greater rate of loan repayment, we consider it as evidence of a poverty trap and an effective measure to break it. One condition for taking up a larger loan size is a household capacity that accommodates cattle rearing, in terms of household labour and/or a space to house the livestock. \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{Consistent with such interpretation, we find lower enrollment rates of boys at primary school ages in later periods, which is likely to arise from the increased labour demand by households. }

	The previous literature has shown that returns to lending are higher for the borrowers with business experiences \citep{BanerjeeKarlanZinman2015}. To check if the same can be found in our experiment, we divide the subjects into three groups of different cattle rearing experiences at the baseline: \textsf{Owner} group, defined by the cattle ownership, \textsf{Adi} group, defined by no cattle ownership but having an experience with cattle lease contracts (called \textit{Adi}) within three years prior to the baseline, and \textsf{None} group who has neither of the two. In \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetsByExperienceEffects}} and \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NumCowsByExperienceEffects}}, we show how impacts on the net assets and cattle holding differ by the experience group. Net asset results in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetsByExperienceEffects}} do not show differences by experience except for \textsf{Adi} group of \textsf{Large grace} arm. Cattle holding results in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NumCowsByExperienceEffects}} show that the \textsf{Owner} group has the largest point estimates in both outcomes under the \textsf{Large/Upfront} and \textsf{Cattle} treatments, followed by the \textsf{None} group, and virtually no impact among the \textsf{Adi} group. The \textsf{Owner} group estimates are mostly larger than \textsf{None} group estimates yet the CIs are wider. This is due to smaller sample size of \textsf{Owner} group, which is precisely the problem of the area that motivated this study.

	Consistent with the previous literature, there are some cases of higher returns to microfinance among the members with previous cattle rearing experience through ownership in cattle holding, and also though leasehood for net assets, although these differences do not have low $p$ values. We also find the returns among the members with no previous experience are smaller yet not statiscally zero in some cases. In particular, when we choose cattle holding as an outcome in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NumCowsByExperienceEffects}}, \textsf{Cattle} arm has a statistically meaningful impact even among the \textsf{None} group, which is consistent with our main finding that the managerial support program may have helped them in participating and sustaining the level of returns. 

%	In contrast, the \textsf{Adi} group, who has cattle rearing experiences, does not attain statistically positive returns. As one examines the estimated results in \textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA net assets experience}} and \textsc{\footnotesize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA narrow net assets Experience timevarying attributes 1}}, we see that the returns of \textsf{Adi} group becomes negligible once we add baseline household size \textsf{HHsize0} as a covariate, which has large positive estimates across specifications. This is indicative of \textsf{Adi} group is constrained by the household size, which is consistent with our main finding that a domestic capacity constraint, be it domestic labor or house building size or both, may bind some households to attain positive returns	, possibly because they are already engaging in cattle rearing.

	We also ran a robustness check over the choice of asset concepts by using various measures of net assets in \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetsNetBroadAssetsNLAssetsCattleEffects}}: \textsf{Net broad assets} which we include all other household assets that are observed in certain rounds of surveys, \textsf{Net assets, annual price} which we use annual median price of cattle in computing the livestock values in net assets, \textsf{Net non-livestock assets} which we drop livestock values from net assets, and \textsf{Cattle} which is the number of cattle holding.  In the Appendix \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig AssetCumRelativeToConcurrentTradEffects}}, we show the time paths of various assets by arm. The dynamic patterns of asset accumulation is similar to  \textsf{Net assets} of \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssets}}.\footnote{Asset values are expressed in BDT. \textsf{Net assets}=total assets - debts. Debts include outstanding loaned amount of the experiment. Total assets use items observed in all 4 rounds of household surveys. \textsf{Net non livestock assets}=\textsf{net assets}-livestock asset values. \textsf{Number of cattle} is a headcount of cattle holding.  } 

	As expected, all asset measures show similar impact patterns. \textsf{Net broad assets} show a similar pattern as in the \textsf{Net assets}. However, the standard error bars cross zero in round 4 for some specifications, possibly because of larger noises in computing the values as some asset items are observed only in certain rounds.

	We examined if the impacts differ by poverty class. The impacts on net assets, net non-livestock assets, cattle holding are not statistically different between the poverty classes (see \textsc{\footnotesize Figure {\ref{fig NetAssetsNLAssetsCattleUltraPoorEffects}}} of Appendix {\ref{Subsec By poverty class}}). \SeiroAdded{yellow!50}{However, we find negative impacts on consumption for the ultra poor relative to the moderately poor in \textsf{Large} and \textsf{Cattle} arms in period 3 and 4, while labour incomes are not affected (\textsc{\footnotesize Figure {\ref{fig IncomeConsumptionPovertyEffects}}}). This hints that the repayment efforts may have resulted in consumption suppression for the ultra poor borrowers. To help smoothing the repayment burden of the ultra poor borrowers over time, an option of a longer maturity or a longer pre-disbursement period to accommodate larger saving build up may induce their loan take up. We observe that the ultra poor are more likely to experience cash shortfall, however, their repayment rates are no lower. This is another evidence of repayment discipline that the ultra poor borrowers put repayment before consumption.}   %Poverty gradation through a participatory process, however, does not distinguish the moderately poor and the ultra poor on the observables. \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig NetAssetValuesAtRd1}} shows net asset values at baseline by poverty class, and \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig LivestockValuesAtRd1}} shows initial livestock values at baseline by poverty class. Both show little difference in these observable characteristics. \textcolor{red}{[According to Abu-san, participatory poverty gradation may have been imprecise.]}

	The poverty reduction impacts of microfinance was a firm belief in the early days of microfinance. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Yet its outreach is slow and the returns are modest. In this study, we examined the role of upfront liquidity, a grace period, entrepreneurship in leaping benefits.}

	This study employs a stepped-wedge design of multiple arms to isolate different functional attributes of loan contracts: Upfront liquidity, a grace period, and in-kind loan with management supports. These functional attributes are intended to relax various constraints in productive investsments by the poor: A liquidity constraint, a saving constraint, and an entrepreneurship constraint. Only the upfront disbursement matters in all outcomes, which signifies the importance of a liquidity constraint. With evidence that borrowers with upfront liqudity arms invested in cattle while the borrowers under incremental lending invested in multiple, smaller projects, and the repayment rates are higher for the upfront liquidity arms, we conclude that there is a poverty trap which cannot be overcome by the traditional approach of microfinance. Under the study's setting, escaping from the poverty trap requires upfront disbursements, not incremental as practiced by the majority of microfinance institutions. In addition, lending rather than a transfer may suffice to support the transition. 

	We showed, \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{under the rural setting in the context of cattle production, experiences or entrepreneurship does not affect the mean outcomes. This is in contrast to other microfinance impact evaluations that show returns to experiences and skills. While impacts are no different, managerial supports induced participation of smaller asset holders and achieved less variable returns on investments. This implies that managerial supports can invite more disadvantaged prospective borrowers without adversely affecting the outcomes. Our impacts are large across the board, and there is no returns to entrepreneurship nor experiences, which are all consistent with the previous studies of greenfield population who are not exposed to microfinance that show inherently greater impacts than the intensive margins} {\citep{CullMorduch2018, BueraKaboskiShin2020}}.

	We have witnessed that a binding domestic capacity constraint may impede potential borrowers from participation. This limits the potential benefit of large, upfront lending. \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{Consistent with this, we have seen negative impacts on schooling of primary school aged boys.} While it in unclear why the outsourced labour cannot substitute the domestic labour, one can organise an arrangement in each group, tended by the group members, to collectively graze the cattle during the daytime. This partly eases the domestic labour and/or space constraints faced by small households. 

	\SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{We observed a grace period does not result in differences in mean outcomes. At the mean, a saving constraint does not bind. However, in targeting the ultra poor, we find slower net asset growth during the initial period and negative consumption effects toward the end of repayment, which we interpret as a binding saving constraint. This suggests that giving an option of a longer saving period prior to lending and/or a longer maturity, may be necessary for the ultra poor. At the same time, we find the asset impacts of the ultra poor are no different from the moderately poor borrowers of the same arms. This validates that the production opportunity is no inferiror for the ultra poor individuals. }

	We note that our study site is rich in rainfall, giving more advantages to cattle production over sheep/goat production. In contrast, if the climate is more arid, sheep and goats are better suited because of less water logging and their greater viability in relying on natural grass. This raises a concern that our results may not directly transferrable to more arid areas. However, \SeiroAdded{\BGColour}{one of the} the key lessons from the study is the presence of fixed inputs in scaling the herd size. While sheep/goats are easier to scale than cattle, it will require larger land and roofed facilities at some point as one increases the herd size. This can effectively form nonconvexity in the production set, and large enough finance may allow herders to go pass the threshold. 

	We have seen that borrowers accumulated assets but did not increase consumption. This is consistent with a high morale of repayment, which can partly be explained by the lack of alternative lenders in the study area. With stronger incentives to repay, the evidence on stronger repayment discipline of large sized arm members need not generalise to the areas outside the study site. On the other hand, the necessity of codifiable knowledge in participation even for a simple production process and the scope for escaping the poverty trap with large, upfront lending may be generalisable to other rural areas with liquidity constraints.

% Randomisation tests are done in PermutationTestsContents.rnw
In \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab perm}}, we use \textsf{independence\_test} of \textsf{R}'s \textsf{coin} package: Approximate permutation tests by randomly resampling 100000 times. The test examines if the arm $a$'s mean is different from all other arms' means. This is done by randomly reassigning group labels to get the permuted distribution of arm $a$ means. If the arm $a$ does not differ from non-$a$ arms, then the $p$ value becomes large (non small). All the values are relatively large, except for \textsf{Time preference 1, Time preference 2} of \textsf{Traditional} arm are around 20\%.

In \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{table anova CattleHoldingArm}}, we show the cattle ownership ratios by each arm  at various points in time and examine their equality with ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Tukey Honest Significant Test. For ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis, each entry indicates $p$ values. ANOVA tests for the null of equality of all means under normality. Kruskal-Wallis tests for the null of no stochastic dominance among samples without using the normality assumption. Tukey's honest significant tests show difference in means and $p$ values in parenthesis that account for multiple testing under the normality assumption.  

In column (1), for example, the final round cattle holding is tested. ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis give .06\% and .07\%, respectively. Tukey HST is tested for each pair wise differences in ownewship ratios. \textsf{Large-Traditional} shows .5016 percentage points larger for \textsf{Large} arm relative to \textsf{Traditional}, and the null $p$ value of equality is .02\%. Likewise, \textsf{Large grace-Traditional, Cattle-Traditional} give $p$ values of 2.35\% and 6.90\%, respectively. Differences between arms with large loan size, \textsf{Large, Large grace, Cattle} show relatively large $p$ values. It shows the results are statistically different between \textsf{Traditional} and the other arms. 

Similarly, columns (2) to (5) show test results at each different points of time. In column (2), we edited the data by assigning 1 to members of \textsf{Cattle} arm who report holding is NA or zero at round 4. We did so because there is a possibility of misreporting and decided to check the sensitivity of permutation test results if we correct them. We see effectively no difference between (1) and (2) except the difference \textsf{Cattle-Traditional} becomes larger and associated $p$ value becomes smaller. Looking at (5), all the $p$ values are large and do not indicate statistically meaningful differences between arms.

Among 776 observations, there are 40 whose villages are washed away by a flood and 70 who, by group decisions, rejected the assigned arms (traditional, large, large grace with 40, 20, 10 individuals, respectively). There are 31, 9, 13, 37 individuals who individually rejected traditional, large, large grace, cattle, respectively. %Among attrited HHs, when were they lost?

%	\noindent\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{grep(TabLabelStringsRej[1], TabLabel1)}} to \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{grep(TabLabelStringsRej[13], TabLabel1)}}: Trimmed sample.\\

	\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of rejection}} shows test results of independence between loan receivers and nonreceivers (group, individual rejecters) on the analysis sample of 776 members. It shows that lower head literacy, smaller household size, being affected by flood at the baseline, smaller livestock holding, and smaller net assets are correlated with opting out the offered type of lending. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of rejection among traditional arm}} indicates that lower asset and livestock holding is more pronounced among \textsf{traditional} rejecters relative to loan receivers. It also shows that flood exposure is less frequent, contrary to \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of rejection}}, among the rejecters. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of rejection among non-traditional arm}} indicates that lower head literacy, smaller household size, higher flood exposure, are more pronounced among non-\textsf{traditional} rejecters relative to loan receivers. It also shows that asset and livestock holding is no different relative to the receivers. Comparing rejecters of \textsf{traditional} arm, lower flood exposure may be the only stark difference against non-\textsf{traditional} arm members, and smaller asset and livestock holding is merely suggestive (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of rejecters, traditional vs. non-traditional arm}}). 
	
	Group rejecters and non-group rejecters are compared in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of group rejection}}. Marked differences are found in \textsf{Arm} (proportion of non-\textsf{traditional} arm members) and head literacy. \textsf{TimePrefVal1} and \textsf{TimePrefVal2} are values of premium required to give up the immediate gratification, now or 1 year from now, respectively. \textsf{TimePrefVal2} shows that group rejecters are less impatient than the non-group rejecters. In the meantime, group rejecters have a higher proportion of individuals with present bias as indicated in \textsf{PresentBias}. There are no difference in terms of risk tolerance in \textsf{RiskPrefVal}. Group rejecters tend to have smaller livestock assets, as indicated by \textsf{NumCows, LivestockValue} and smaller overall assets in \textsf{NarrowNetValue, NetValue}. 
	\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of group rejection among traditional arm}} compares group rejecters in \textsf{traditional} arm and finds smaller flood exposure and lower livestock and net asset holding are associated with group rejection. Group rejecters in non-\textsf{traditional} arm are examined in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of group rejection among non-traditional arm}} and younger head age, flood at baseline, and smaller household asset holding are correlated with rejection. We also note group rejecters in non-\textsf{traditional} arms are less impatient but have a higher proportion of present biased members. 

	Comparing group rejecters between \textsf{traditional} and non-\textsf{traditional} arms in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of group rejecters, traditional vs. non-traditional arm}}, younger head age, higher flood exposure, larger net asset values and livestock holding are noted among the non-\textsf{traditional} group rejecters. These hint that for non-\textsf{traditional} arm group rejecters, it is the smaller household size and the baseline flood that may have constrained them from participation, and for \textsf{traditional} group rejecters, it is the low asset levels. Comparison of individual rejecters between \textsf{traditional} and non-\textsf{traditional} arms show no detectable difference (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of individual rejecters, traditional vs. non-traditional arm}}). This suggests that indvidual rejecters in all arms were constrained with small household size and small asset holding.

%	\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[1]}} shows results from tests of independence between attriters and nonattriters. We see the moderate rate of attrition is not correlated with household level characteristics at the conventional $p$ value level. Productive asset amounts seem to differ between attriters and nonattriters, with the former being larger than the latter. This positive attrition selection can cause underestimation of impacts, if the asset values are positively correlated with entrepreneurial capacity. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("of attri.* traditional arm$", TabLabel1)]}} shows attrition in the \textsf{traditional} arm. Household heads of attriters are relatively less literate than nonattriters. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("of attri.* non-traditional arm$", TabLabel1)]}} compares attriters and nonattriters in the non-\textsf{traditional} arm. Unlike \textsf{traditional} arm attriters, non-\textsf{traditional} arm attriters have more literate household heads, have a larger household size, are more exposed to floods, and have larger productive assets. The \textsf{traditional} arm attriters may be less entrepreneurial, if anything, so their attrition may upwardly bias the positive gains of the arm, hence understate the impacts of non-\textsf{traditional} arm. These are explicitly shown in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("of attri.* of", TabLabel1)]}} where we compare attriters of \textsf{traditional} and non-\textsf{traditional} arms. Overall, attrition may have attenuated the impacts but is not likely to have inflated them.\footnote{So one can employ the Lee bounds for stronger results, but doing so will give us less precision and require more assumptions. We will not use the Lee bounds \textcolor{red}{[we can show them if necessary]}. }

%	For the microfinance institutions (MFIs), attrition of the loan receiving members poses a threat to their business continuation. Financial institutions often use observable characteristics, such as collateralisable assets, and easily surveyed chracteristics, such as job experiences and schooling of borrowers, and are likely to lend if the assets levels are greater and the borrowers have relevant job experiences and more schooling. We first examine if such screening variables have any predictive power in terms of loan rejection or borrower attrition under our lending. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("survival$", TabLabel1)]}} compares potential MFI targets (nonattriting borrowers, noted as \textsf{Survived}) vs. non-targets (attriting borrowers or loan rejecters, noted as \textsf{NonSurvived}) in all arms. It shows potential targets at the baseline have larger values in livestock and greater number of cattle, and are less affected by the flood, which conforms the conventional wisdom of lenders in using these aspects in their loan decisions. Next, we examine if the relationship of having ``less favourable'' values in these characteristics and attrition is mitigated under various loan characteristics. In \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{gsub("surviving members", "non-attriting borrowers", TabLabel1[grep("surviving members of cattle and large grace", TabLabel1)])}}, we restrict our attention to the potential MFI targets, or the nonattriting borrowers, and compare between \textsf{cattle} and \textsf{large grace} arms, whose difference is efffectively the presence of managerial supports that the former provides. \label{PageOfAttrition}%Comparing the nonattriting borrower, characteristics are similar except that the \textsf{traditional} members are more exposed to the flood than the non-\textsf{traditional} members. 
%	Comparing against the \textsf{large grace} arm, nonattriting borrowers of the \textsf{cattle} arm are more exposed to the flood ($p=.055$), have less productive assets ($p=.003$), have lower net asset values ($p=.046$), and have fewer livestock ($p=.137$). This shows that the smaller livestock holders or less experienced individuals are encouraged to participate and continue to operate in the \textsf{cattle} arm that has a managerial support program, with all other features being equal. This is consistent with our analysis of participation in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("bo.*non-ca", TabLabel1)]}} which weakly hints that the \textsf{cattle} arm's managerial support programs may have encouraged participation of inexperienced or lower asset holders. This also underscores our interpretation that the current impact estimates may be downward biased, if any, as people who would otherwise attrit or reject in cattle arm stayed on. This result is confirmed with lower $p$ values due to a larger sample size when we compare the nonattriting borrowers between \textsf{cattle} arm with other arms in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{gsub("surviving members", "non-attriting borrowers", TabLabel1[grep("surviving members of cattle and all", TabLabel1)])}}. At the baseline, \textsf{cattle} arm nonattriting borrowers have smaller baseline livestock holding ($p$ value = .016) and smaller baseline net asset holding ($p$ value = .007) than other arms' nonattriting borrowers. 


	\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of attrition}} shows results from tests of independence between attriters and nonattriters. Attrition is defined as attrition from household surveys, not from the lending program. We see the moderate rate of attrition is not correlated with household level characteristics%, except less risk torelance in \textsf{RiskPrefVal}, 
	at the conventional $p$ value level. Productive asset amounts seem to differ between attriters and nonattriters at $p=.105$, with the former being larger than the latter. This positive attrition selection can cause underestimation of impacts, if the asset values are positively correlated with entrepreneurial capacity. We also see that the attriters are less risk tolerant in terms of minimum expected payoff to choose a risky option in \textsf{RiskPrefVal}. \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of attrition among traditional arm}} shows attrition in the \textsf{traditional} arm. Household heads of attriters are relatively less literate than nonattriters. We observe the \textsf{traditional} arm attriters are less risk tolerant the nonattriters.
	\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of attrition among non-traditional arm}} compares attriters and nonattriters in the non-\textsf{traditional} arm. Unlike \textsf{traditional} arm attriters, non-\textsf{traditional} arm attriters have more literate household heads, have a larger household size, are more exposed to floods, and have larger productive assets. The \textsf{traditional} arm attriters may be less entrepreneurial, if anything, so their attrition may upwardly bias the positive gains of the arm, hence understate the impacts of non-\textsf{traditional} arm. These are explicitly shown in \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of attriters of traditional and non-traditional arms}} where we compare attriters of \textsf{traditional} and non-\textsf{traditional} arms. Overall, attrition may have attenuated the impacts but is not likely to have inflated them. We observe the non-\textsf{traditional} arm attriters are also less risk tolerant than the nonattriters.

It shows potential targets at the baseline have larger values in livestock and greater number of cattle, and are less affected by the flood, which conforms the conventional wisdom of lenders in using these aspects in their loan decisions. We also see that more risk torelant members are likely to be borrowers and do not attrit. Next, we examine if the relationship of having ``less favourable'' values in these characteristics and attrition is mitigated under various loan characteristics. In \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab1 Permutation test results of active members of cattle and large grace arms}}, we restrict our attention to the potential MFI targets, or the nonattriting borrowers, and compare between \textsf{cattle} and \textsf{large grace} arms, whose difference is efffectively the presence of managerial supports that the former provides. \label{PageOfAttrition}%Comparing the nonattriting borrower, characteristics are similar except that the \textsf{traditional} members are more exposed to the flood than the non-\textsf{traditional} members.

%	Group rejecters of \textsf{traditional} and non-\textsf{traditional} arms differ in household characteristics. Lower livestock values, smaller cattle holding, and smaller net asset values are associated with group rejection for \textsf{traditional} arm (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("p rej.* traditional arm$", TabLabel1)]}}), while higher baseline flood exposure rates and younger household heads are associated with group rejection for non-\textsf{traditional} arms (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("p rej.*g non-traditional arm$", TabLabel1)]}}). Given randomisation, we conjecture that it is lack of \textsf{Upfront} liquidity that prevented smaller livestock holders of \textsf{traditional} arm from participating because they cannot purchase cattle due to insufficient net asset values or an insufficient resale value of owned livestock, when members of similar characteristics partcipated in non-\textsf{traditional} arms. %This is a real resource constraint that binds the households. This is different from a psychological constraint that, so long as there is a cost or a payment involved, albeit at a minimal level, there remains a group of households who would not take up the investment \citep{Ashraf2010, CohenDupas2010}. 
%	For non-\textsf{traditional} arm rejecters, it is the past flood that kept members from participating, even they are younger and have similar cattle holding as the non group-rejecters. 

%	Individual rejecters of \textsf{traditional} arm and non-\textsf{traditional} arms share similar characteristics (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("l rej.*vs", TabLabel1)]}}). In fact, they are not very different in all the variables considered. %This is consistent with the conjecture that, had the \textsf{traditional} arm group rejecters been offered any of the non-\textsf{traditional} arms, they, as a group, may have accepted it.  %It shows the latter is more exposed to flood in baseline and has larger livestock values. This implies that, once large enough sum of loan is disbursed, %there is no minimum livestock and asset holding level to partake in the larger loans, and 
	%despite a negative asset shock in flood and a poverty trap at this level may be overcome once household size and negative asset shocks are accounted for.
%	The common factors associated with nonparticipation are a smaller household size and smaller livestock holding (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("l rej.*g tra", TabLabel1)]}} and \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("l rej.*g non-", TabLabel1)]}}), although the $p$ values for livestock holding difference between individual rejecters and non individual rejecters are around 7\% (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{TabLabel1[grep("l rejection$", TabLabel1)]}}). %In non-\textsf{traditional} arms, the individual rejecters have only marginally different mean values relative to individual nonrejecters (\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab Ireject nontrad perm}}).

	In this section, the ANCOVA estimates on various outcomes using %\eqref{1steq} and 
	\eqref{2ndeq} are presented. In each table, the first column shows the covariate names and their means and standard deviations in the second column in the sample of the richest specification of the table. Specification (1) follows the most basic specification under \eqref{2ndeq}. From (2), we progressively add more covariates to control for the differences in initial conditions in an attempt to get more precise ANCOVA estimates. In \textsc{\footnotesize Figure \ref{fig IncomeConsumptionEffects}}, we use OLS estimates. It regresses on the intercept, $\bfdee_{i}$, and its period interactions. 
	
	We annotate the number of periods that a household is observed with \textsf{T}. The total number of households is shown for each values of \textsf{T}. \textsf{T=4} indicates the number of households with complete panel information, \textsf{T=3} indicates number of households observed three times, \textsf{T=2} indicates the number of households observed twice. \textsf{N} indicates total number of observations used in ANCOVA estimation, or \textsf{N$=$1$\times$(T=2)+2$\times$(T=3)+3$\times$(T=4)}.

Loan years are defined with the ellapsed months since the first disbursement date, 13-24 for \textsf{LY2}, 25-36 for \textsf{LY3}, and 37-48 for \textsf{LY4}. Fixed effects are controlled by differencing out respecive means from the data matrix. Shortfall $y_{it}$ is (planned installment) - (actual repayment). \textsf{Group shortfall}$_{t-1}$ indicates a one month lagged mean shortfall amount of a group. \textsf{Per member group net saving}$_{t-1}$ and \textsf{Per member cumulative group net saving (BDT1000)}$_{t-1}$ give one month lagged average net saving in a group and their accumulated sums, respectively. Median group repayent shortfall rate is -1.42. 69 groups participated in the lending program. \\

\textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA narrow net assets Experience timevarying 1}} and \textsc{\normalsize Table \ref{tab ANCOVA narrow net assets Experience timevarying 2} (continued)} show estimation after dividing into three subsamples: Individuals who had a cattle lease contract (\textsf{Adi}, $n=92$) at the baseline, individuals who owned cattle at the baseline (\textsf{Own}, $n=137$), and individuals who had neither (\textsf{None}, $n=505$). The total of 734 is fewer than baseline sample size of 774 as we lost 40 observations by round 2. The number of individuals with \textsf{Adi} is small that makes the estimates inprecise. Specifications (2) - (4) show that the individuals of \textsf{Own} responded well to the non-\textsf{Traditional} lending by round 2, particularly so under \textsf{Large} and \textsf{Large grace} arms. Individuals of \textsf{None} have the smallest net asset holding under \textsf{Traditional} as indicated by the intercept terms. They have excess positive returns under all non-\textsf{Traditional} arms relative to the \textsf{Traditional} arm. Among the individuals of \textsf{None}, or who had no prior cattle rearing experience at the baseline, the \textsf{Cattle} arm gives the higher mean returns than the \textsf{Large grace} arm. As argued in the main text, it strongly suggests that the effective difference of the two arms, the managerial support program, resulted in a higher return for the \textsf{None} group.
%It is interesting that they had smaller excess returns to \textsf{Large} and \textsf{Large grace} arms relative to \textsf{Own} group, yet they had a greater excess returns to \textsf{Cattle} arm. In fact, returns to \textsf{Traditional} arm in \textsf{Own} group by round 2 is 17273.5 while the return to \textsf{Cattle} in \textsf{None} group is 10886+9666.7. 

The household size is positively correlated with the net asset values in \textsf{Adi} and \textsf{None} groups while not in \textsf{Own} group. This implies that there may be selection into cattle ownership at the baseline that requires a certain household size, either labour and/or a barn, and \textsf{Own} group may already have a way to acquire them as they become necessary. Returns to baseline net asset holding is meaningful only among the \textsf{Own} group, and estimates on other groups are less precise. \textsf{Adi} group has a large point estimate, although the $p$ value is greater than .1, which is consistent with a conjecture that the skills acquired through Adi have high returns but they are cash constrained.

}


\textsc{Figure \ref{fig NetAssetsNLAssetsCattleUltraPoorEffects}} shows net asset impacts are no different for the ultra poor borrowers at period 4. However, their time paths may be different. In \textsf{Large grace} and \textsf{Cattle} arms, the ultra poor borrowers accumulate smaller net assets in period 2 than their moderately poor counterparts of the same arms. Period 2 is the grace period and the repayment commence in the next period. The ultra poor borrowers may have saved up during the grace period to get ready for the installments of period 3 and 4. If this interpretation is correct, a grace period may have encouraged the ultra poor individuals to take up the loans. The ultra poor of \textsf{Large} arm does not show difference relative to the moderately poor borrowers. This hints that there may be self-selection of the ultra poor of the \textsf{Large} arm that they are better prepared for repayment than the ultra poor borrowers of \textsf{Large grace} and \textsf{Cattle} arms. There is no difference between arms for \textsf{Net non-livestock assets}, while the ultra poor of \textsf{Large} arm may have more cattle holding in period 4 than the moderately poor of the same arm. 

\textsc{Figure \ref{fig IncomeConsumptionPovertyEffects}} shows negative impacts on consumption relative to moderately poor members among \textsf{Large} and \textsf{Cattle} arms in period 4. This hints that repayment efforts may have resulted in consumption suppression for the ultra poor borrowers. Together with slower net asset accumulation, we may need to incorporate smaller, more distributed repayment installments and/or longer saving opportunities before the disbursement of loans for the ultra poor relative to the moderately poor.
