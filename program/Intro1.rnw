	Since the microcredit became popular in Bangladesh in the late 1980's, the number of borrowers increased rapidly throughout the world. According to over 3700 microfinance institutions (MFIs), there are estimated 204 million borrowers around the world in 2013, of which 110 million are the poor borrowers whose incomes are below the national poverty line \citep{MFGateway2015}. The outreach to the extremely poor population or the \textit{ultra poor}, however, is arguably slow in comparison.\footnote{MF is not successful in reaching out to the poorest of the poor, or the ultra poor \citep[][]{Scully2004}. Empirical evidence in \citet{Yaron1994, Navajas2000, RahmanRazzaque2000, AghionMorduch2007} supports this claim. Some authors discuss the tradeoff between sustainability and outreach for microfinance institutions (MFIs) \citet{HermesLensink2011, HermesLensinkMeesters2011, Cull2011}. } This is in contrast with the idea that ``everyone is an entrepreneur'' where credits can be productively supplied to the people of any income levels.\textcolor{red}{[Abu-san: Can you get a reference for this in the \BibTeX format? I have a 2017 Guardian article quoting \href{we are all entrepreneurs}{https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/29/we-are-all-entrepreneurs-muhammad-yunus-on-changing-the-world-one-microloan-at-a-time}]}

	The potential reasons behind the slow outreach to the ultra poor can be classified into demand and supply sides. On the demand side, the ultra poor borrowers may not be entrepreneurial enough to demand credits for production, or may face an inferior production possibility than wealthier borrowers. On the supply side, MFIs may perceive the ultra poor as riskier than the moderately poor, or their loan size may be too small to justify the fixed transaction costs while the lender is constrained to keep the interest rate low to avoid adverse selection and moral hazard. However, the creditworthiness of the ultra poor and the resultant welfare dynamics have been rarely examined empirically. The majority of existing programs targeting the ultra poor, exemplified by BRAC graduation program, are based on grants rather than loans.

	In assessing the creditworthiness and the suitable debt contract scheme for the ultra poor on a quasi-commercial basis, we ran a randomised controlled trial on the poorest population in the river island areas of northern Bangladesh. By changing the conditions on the credit supply, we estimate and test the effects of demand side constraints. Specifically, by collaborating with a local NGO, we assigned the following four arms that have the equivalent loan size: \textsf{(T1)} A traditional Grameen-style microcredit programme with a small loan amount, which requires clients to start repayment within two weeks after receiving the loan, with one-year maturity. Loan disbursement is repeated twice so the total loan size becomes the same with other schemes; \textsf{(T2)} A loan that is three times larger than the regular programme with three-year maturity; \textsf{(T3)} A loan that is equivalent to \textsf{T2}, except that it comes with a one-year grace period before they start to repay; \textsf{(T4)} An in-kind loan equivalent to the third one bundled with a managerial support component. In short, four arms differ in frontloaded liquidity, grace period, lending vehicle and bundling of support programs. The experiment takes a stepped-wedge design over these key functional attributes of loans. By comparing the additional traits assigned to each treatment arm, this study aims to identify the demand-side constraints as well as welfare and asset dynamics under alternative debt contracts. 
	%we test the necessity of entrepreneurial skills in successfully completing a loan cycle. To do so, we offered a packaged loan that bundles an asset lease with managerial support programs which is intended to render entrepreneurship unnecessary. Provided that our managerial support program covers a sufficiently wide range of issues, the package is expected to achieve a return that is no smaller than a regular credit, even when the entrepreneurial skills are essential. As we track all --- barring the flood victims whose villages were washed away --- the potential borrowers including who eventually opted out the borrowing, we are able to estimate the intention-to-treat effects of offering loans and their implied necessity for entrepreneurial skills. 
	
	We explore the investment decisions and welfare consequences induced by relaxation of liquidity constraints, through contrasts between \textsf{T1} and other arms. %Since households with a one-year old heifer must wait for another one year before it starts to lactate, we give one year grace period to match the cash flow profile of presumed (dairy cattle) production in treatment \textsf{(T3)} and \textsf{(T4)}.  
	The arm that bundles an asset lease (one-year old heifer) with managerial support programs is intended to render entrepreneurship unnecessary, which is thought to be one of the major constraints for the ultra poor to access the microcredit. Provided that our managerial support program offers a sufficiently wide range of services, it is expected to attract individuals with smaller entrepreneurial capacity, and/or to achieve a return that is no smaller than a regular credit, even when the entrepreneurial skills are essential. 
	%A heifer needs to be at least 2 years old to start lactation. As the packaged loan provides a heifer of one year old, we give one year of grace period. In comparing with the classic Grameen style loan that is smaller in amount and has no grace period, we add two more treatment arms which jointly serve as a bridge between the two, large loan arms with and without a grace period. For the Grameen style loans which serves as a control group, we repeat loan disbursement twice so the total loan size becomes the same for all arms. We thereby obtain a stepped-wedge design over the key attributes of loans, i.e., frontloaded liquidity, a grace period, and in-kind loans with support programs.

	Our study closely follows the literature of microfinance design as hallmarked in \citet{Field2013} who found a grace period induces more risk taking and subsequent loan delinquency. Similar to their study, we allow selected borrowers a grace period in repayment. Under our setting, however, it is irrational to invest in riskier assets, such as goats, when the designed grace period suits the actual cash flow and a heifer has a Pareto-dominant risk-return investment profile. A strategic default is also more difficult in our setting because the number of alternative credit suppliers is limited, which is probably zero.\footnote{As we surveyed the area before the study, we note several NGOs provide a relief credit to flood victims, not regular finance. We also choose population without access to any financial institution.\textcolor{red}{[Abu-san: A better description for this?]} } We therefore expect a larger loan size, longer maturity, and a grace period would not directly result in moral hazard both in \textit{ex ante} and \textit{ex post} sense. The repayment rates are no lower than the comparable microfinance schemes \citep{BanerjeeKarlanZinman2015}.

	Our study is closely related to a large scale cattle transfer study conducted in the neighbouring area \citep{BandieraBRAC2017, Balboni2020}. The targeted population of their study is similar to ours, yet our study population resides on less stable terrain, are more exposed to flood and water logging, are considered to be less well connected to the market, are equally less trained, and are probably poorer. The chance of survival for each investment is expected to be no higher. The difference in experimental design is that they use a transfer while we use loans and leases, and charge a market-rate fee to everything we provide. Our experiment is designed to be financially viable if the repayment is made.

	Our study is also related to the poverty trap literature. With the stepped-wedge design, the difference in the upfront liquidity allows us to test if there is an increasing returns to scale, or nonconvexity in the production set. A nonconvex production set under a liquidity constraint is considered as the leading cause of a poverty trap in development economics \citep{GalorZeira1993}. In our study area, a regular, small scale loan is just the size of acquiring a goat or a sheep, while a larger sized arm allows a purchase of a heifer. When the return to a heifer is higher than to a goat/sheep, there is a scope of poverty trap because a heifer cannot be acquired in parts and the borrower is facing a binding credit constraint. Our study therefore adds micro-level evidence of a poverty trap that is frequently studied in macroeconomics.
	
	We found that having large liquidity in upfront leads to faster asset accumulation and higher loan repayment rates. We consider this as evidence of a poverty trap which is formed by the nonconvex production set of a heifer. This is consistent with the recent study by \citet{Balboni2020}. There is little difference in the outcomes between cash and in-kind lending as well as with and without a grace period. This implies they have no ITT effect. We interpret this as due to a more homogenous investment opportunity in the area compared with the urban setting of \citet{Field2013}. Looking closely at the participant characteristics, however, in-kind lending with a managerial support attracted the borrowers with fewer cattle rearing experiences and lower asset values. In interpretation, people who are not entrepreneurial enough to overcome few cattle rearing experiences and not entrepreneurial enough to take risks at a low asset level did not participate in the cash lending arms, while did so in the in-kind lending arm. This hints some entrepreneurship is required for microfinance participation and repayments, and the managerial support program might have closed such gaps without affecting the impacts on assets relative to other arms. 

	In line with the concensus of the previous literature reviews, we believe that our finding is generalisable to the areas where livestock production is the primary livelihood opportunity. However, there is a caveat that the domain of our results is a low level herd size that matches the scale of lower equilibrium of \citet{Lybbertetal2004}, and the entrepreneurial capacity required to hold around 50 herd size, the scale of high equilibrium, can be different from what our study suggests. 
	
	%We found that entrepreneurship is not a prerequisite for microfinance lending and repayments. There is little difference in the outcomes between the in-kind lending and cash lending. We intepret this as due to a more homogenous investment opportunity in the area compared with the urban setting of \citet{Field2013}. We found that having upfront liquidity is the key to faster asset accumulation and higher loan repayment rates. We consider this as evidence of a poverty trap which is formed by the nonconvex production set of heifer.
